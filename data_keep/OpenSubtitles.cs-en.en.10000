Cha.. Moo..hyuk
I'll make a lot of money. And go to Korea.
Wait, mother!
I'll go and place you in luxury.
Is it wrong if you think of love as a game too?
Later when that person betrays you, hurts you.. have a big heart, don't get heartbroken...
You're not well.
In your head.... there's still a bullet there.
Are you Korean?
You're Korean?
I'm saved!
Arrange a meeting with my mother.
Of course.
It's about time.
Who is it?
Let me use the bathroom.
But who is it?
-Bathroom.. Let me use the bathroom!
It's not public.
-I'm going to pee my pants.
Let me use the bathroom.
-Then go! I won't stop you.
What a wacko!
Hey!
Australia, right?
Right? Right? Australia, at Melbourne.
Don't you remember me? No.
It seems right?
Do you live here?
-Yes.
Maybe he's not the same person?
Is this your house?
-No, it's not mine. We just live in the basement for rent.
This house is a rich person's house, right?
Yes.
-So...
Is it a hella rich house?
But hey!
Why'd you piss at stranger's house?
Why would you do that?
Your piss!
I marked this place as my territory.
Dogs mark their territory like this.
What the. How can this place be your territory?
See you again.
I'll come to pee again tomorrow.
What is this. So is he saying that he's a dog? Wha?
That's right. I'm a dog.
Not a human being. A dog!
Your mom was a famous movie star a long time ago... And your brother is one of the top singer in our country. Killer, huh?
We found out about it....
You are twins...
What a weird person I meet as I live. Ugh, disgusting.
How filthy!
Are you Korean?
You're Korean?
Hey...
I have a husband..
Just go to sleep... If you don't want to die.
Jason sent you here.
Jason sent you here to kill me!
Did you think I'll get tricked? Do you really think I was going to get tricked by you old man!
How can that lady be my mom? how can that lady be my mom!
She is your mother!
-Don't lie!
If she lives so great, why would she abondon me?
With that money, she can buy all the milk in the world and raise 1000 children!
It's not like it was hard to live or even starve to death.
How, not one but two why would she abandon me!
Your mom is that kind of lady. Anything that gets in her way, children or else?
She's capable of that. Your mom does whatever she wishes.
Shut your mouth. I'm going to kill you.
I'm going to you old man!
Why, did your mom cause an accident again?
I don't want to be the mom?
i want to die. Why?
Is she in another accident?
Then, did he come to find me all the way from Australia?
But how'd he know where I live?
Is he a wacko?
Oh, Yoo!
Pork?
I'm going to put it in the jajang sauce.
It's not in your fridge?
Would you buy some? Yah, with side skins
Sure, thanks!
I'm an excellent cook.
Tangsooyook, Palboochae, Galbijim, shinsunyoo, pasta.
I also clean and do laundry extremely well.
There's nothing I can't do well
Later, I probably can raise babies well.
I won't let your hands touch water.
Well, we have to go there and see? but I'll be a good match for a husband.
Do you like me that much?
Of course
Ah! You're in big trouble Chae Yoon
Have you no idea what you want in a women?
Don't make me sad anymore.
Make me sad again, and I'll really die then.
I'll wait by your house.
I'll wait till you come out.
Sorry.
Pork...
Did he tell me to buy front leg?
Or back leg?
Or was it side skins?
Rock head rock head!
I should die!
You know how much I worked to get that shirt?
These girls need to be in jail and eat bean rice to wake them up.
Is seems like she didn't know. Why don't you forgive her.
I mean why make a big deal with just one shirt.
-Just one shirt?
With just this one shirt, I can feed 5 people in my family.
Nowadays we don't have much customers and we're about to starve to death.
Why did you steal it?
Didn't Galchi teach you that it's bad to steal clothes?
I gave money.
-You did?
Sure, if you pays...then I'll...
That doesn't make sense.
Are you fallen for her or something?
All the guys in my family and neighborhood have been drooling over her...
If you don't put her in jail, I'll going to bring my lawyer!
Why are you crying for?
Huh, why are you crying for.
(she gives narration)
With that brings the end of program...
Oh you're too kind!
When I look at it we can't praise you enough!
This is too much!
Excuse.
Let's talk for a minute
Couple days ago, there was a morning special adoption show right?
-Yes, there was.
Oh, they must be twins.
How cute.
Sorry I contact you again.
I'm sorry but can I hold your baby?
Can I feed him for some milk too?
...I'll give you milk.
Don't wanna? He doesn't want any. Your twins are too cute.
I want to raise twins too.
The mother must feel so happy
It hurts...
More gently!
Wake up!
The sun is up, you guys!
Aigoo, how disgusting.
If I could put you back into my stomache!
Sookchae wake up. Wake up!
Where's Eunchae?
Would she fit beneath the bed, mom?
She's with Yoon to help him out.
You little!
You'd hit your own mother?
- That's what I'm sayin!
Sorry!
I think that girl with thick lips recognizes you.
She probably thinks I just look similar.
Ah, eat.
In the whole world, eating eggs in the Hot Room is the best.
You should have gone somewhere else...why on a Sunday?
If we get caught, we'll die. -Just eat it.
You find it well.
-So this is how Hot Room looks like.
This is fun.
-Right?
Hey, not you too!
Don't you know the danger of another scandal broke loose? -I got it.
I'll be careful.
I don't have make up on, they won't recognize me.
Fruit ice cream is killer here.
-We should come here all the time.
What should we do?
I'll cause a distraction, so sneak away, ok?
Why are you crying, Miss?
Grandmother!
What am I going to do?
What's the matter?
Did someone hit you? -No...
My butt was burning...
Sauna's really hot, grandma
How embarassing.
Yoon
Where are you? -Olympic parkway.
Olympic parkway?
I'll drive Minjoo home and come back.
Hey, you're bleeding! Does it sting?
It stings, huh?
Oh, Minjoo fell and scratched her knee.
You should be careful.
It's ok.
I can take the bus.
You look normal, but how sad.
Here.
Thank you
- Let's go, mother.
What would her parents feel?
Did you eat?
You didn't eat, did you?
You don't look like you did.
Did you like me that much?
Even if you like me that much... All the way from Australia... Why would you come all this way?
Do you know someone who lives here?
You don't even know anyone and yet you still came for me?
It doesn't seem like we talked to each other that much.
But I'm not someone that anyone would like at first sight.
In anycase, thank you for liking a girl like me.
We don't have much food, but do you want to eat at my house?
Let's go. I can't give you my heart, but I can give you food.
Sorry...
Let's go...
This is Yoon's house and our house is over here.
Hey, but our house is this way...
Hey, not there!
This isn't our house...
We'll be in trouble if the lady comes out. Hurry, let's leave...
She probably has her reasons... Who can abandon their own flesh and blood?
Things can happen, right?
People live in poverty, But I hope she's living well!
Your eyes take after your mother's...
And you're all very smart!
I'll make a lot of money, and go back to Korea.
Meet my poor mother, buy her pretty clothes, some kalbi meat, and a gorgeous house.
Just wait, mom!
I'll go there and place you in riches.
Just wait five years!
Oh, how sad...
-Oh, Eunchae, you're here?
You were home?
Stella is so tragic.
-Stella?
Stella from 'Last Concert?
Have you never watched it?
Stella is a sad girl who comes out in the movie,
She has leukemia and, later, dies in front of her lover.
How can her life be like that?
Who mother dies... Her father has an affair and flees with his lover...
And then to abandone Richard who she loved. How hard it must be not to die... Take it easy, ma'am.
It's just a movie.
-It's just a movie, but my heart's aching!
I've watched it five times and everytime my heart hurts.
Son, my son!
It's not Yoon...
Who is that man?
Someone I sort of know...
He came into the wrong house.
What's with him?
Why is that man crying?
I did something wrong.
He must be hurt because of me.
But why did he look at me that way?
I'm sorry
Even though I appreciate it, I already have someone I like... There's no room for you...
Eat this!
Hey, Galchi, eat.
I told you I'm not speaking with you anymore!
I'm sorry...
Talk with me, hmm?
Going off stealing things Mom, I'm so embarrassed to death because of you.
It's so annoying!
I won't do it again. I won't.
You always say that!
Are you stupid?
Didn't you know your mom was stupid?
If she doesn't know, you can just keep telling her.
You can teach her!
Hold your spoon!
You know I'm a gangster, right? Do you want to get hit or do you want to eat?
Eat!
Drink water...
Drink it!
Even though your mom lives her life like that Even though she's an idiot, She doesn't throw away her children.
It's me... Danny...
How are you?
Is Korea good?
Yeah, thanks to you.
I checked into a really nice hotel with the money you gave me. You're right.
It's a lot of money...
Enough to last me a lifetime.
Thank you.
Why aren't you speaking in Korean? Is there something wrong?
I call because I wanted to ask you something.
How long did the doctor say I have to live?
I heard that I was dying but I didn't find out how much time I have left...
Do I have at least...
A year?
Not even...
A year?
Son, my son!
Won't you come and cheer me up?
-Who is that man?
It's your first time seeing me dance, huh?
How was it? The pd says it's corny.
You think it's corny too?
It's corny?
I'm not broadcasting ...I'm going home.
Hey, what's wrong?
Is it really corny?
Did I say that? -Yes.
-When?
- Right now!
It's not that really cool.
It kills!
You really said it was corny.
Is it really good?
When other people say something, you act as if nothing happened but when I say something..
Am I the only one to be pick on? Am I some kind of passing dog?
Not a dog, but a god.
You're my god.
Did you not know that?
If you like it, it's good no matter. If you don't like it, I break down.
I am to die for, right?
How did you get here?
-I have a shooting close by here. It's a short break and I heard Yoon's song.
I wanted to see him.
You should have called.
Where are you shooting?
-Close by here.
When are you singing?
-In a little while.
When I think of my mother, I'm grateful and I start to cry.
For giving birth to me, and raising me up so well.
Why are you here?
To see Yoon.
Let's go.
But there still time till the shooting.
Let go.
Why are you doing this?
Stand right there, Jo Yongho!
Let go of her hand.
-Go back and do your dance.
You can't let go?
Minjoo is my girl.
Let go of her hand.
You starting a fight?
-I told you to let go.
Fine. Let's end it today.
Say it now.
Me or Chae Yoon?
Me or Chae Yoon?
Can you both let go of my wrists?
On tomorrow's sports news page, it's going to be our headline.
My dad is going to explode again.
- Didn't you break up with him?
-I did.
I did but I don't think he can.
You, do you want to see me die today?
Are you two debating?
Always saying you're going to die. Its getting so old.
Do you guys die because of a woman?
Do you die because of a person?
How tedious.
I should stop playing with kids.
I'm sorry but I don't believe in love.
Especially guys like you who always talk about love? I don't believe in it more.
You said that if I died, you'd come along with me.
Chaeyoon didn't you say you loved me more than yourself?
Is that true?
Would that really be true?
Would a love like that.. Exist really?
Yoon can't swim!
He can't swim!
What about Minjoo?
Don't worry.
She's fine.
Stay still!
Would you like to wait a bit? I'll bring Yoon's clothes, wanna wear that?
Wait!
You'll catch cold like that.
You don't listen!
Mister! Wake up!
What'd you do all that time Not knowing how to swim .
It seem like you like that girl. You must been embarrassed a bit.
Are you the person who saved us?
-Maybe...
Thanks, bro.
You don't have a brother, right?
Yes.
Want me to be your brother?
Want to be my little brother?
-We'll see.
Don't want it? Then don't do it.
Brother....
I'll do it.

Subtitles (Rough Translation) Fly-5
Begin the attack!
Gloucester?
!
They're not supposed to be in Serbia!
Their bulky Knightmares are no match!
They should have surrendered when they had the chance!
What?
Cornelia...
Don't tell me, with only one machine...
So this means that the creatures of Area 18 have fallen, right?
Princess, about the mobilization effort...
Sorry, I'll have you accompany me in finishing it.
No need.
Your section has been secured.
Area 11 will be difficult to handle.
I understand.
I will find you, Zero... to avenge Clovis!
I'm home.
Welcome home, Lelouch.
Welcome home, brother.
From the looks of it, you've already ate dinner.
I was worried.
I thought that you might have been caught up in the chaos that person named Zero caused.
I called you, but I couldn't reach you.
Brother?
C.C.-san came all the way here to see you...
C.C.?
Your friend is quite interesting, having only initials for a name.
Yeah...
Could it be... that she's your girlfriend?
Huh?
Our futures are intertwined with one another, right?
By future, do you mean marriage?
No!
No, it's not like that.
So, um... she's kidding...
I hate jokes.
I see.
I'm surprised at how quickly you decided, brother.
But they say, "To each his own", so it may not be that strange, I suppose.
Ah, what are you doing C.C.?
You're all wet.
Here, you need to go to the bathroom.
I'll get you a change of clothes too.
Nanali, I'll clean it up right away, so stay right there.
Also, we were lying before...
A lie, a joke.
Who are you?
I told you.
I'm C.C.
That's not what I mean.
You're...
Supposed to be dead?
Do you like it?
The power I gave you.
As I thought, you're...
Are you unsatisfied?
No, I'm grateful.
You pushed my schedule forward a great deal.
Schedule?
The plan to destroy Britannia.
I thought that it would be a little while longer before I could make my move.
Do you think you can destroy it with just that power?
I was planning to do this even without it.
As expected, you're an interesting person.
What are you going to do from now on?
You're being pursued by the military, aren't you?
Even if you say the military, it's only a small portion of it.
It's enough if I just keep a low profile.
I'll put up with it here.
Hey, you're planning on staying here?
Men sleep on the floor.
That's not the point...
If I get caught, you'll have problems too, won't you?
Being together is even more dangerous.
If I sleep out there, I will be caught.
Not at your convenience, but at mi-
I hate persistent people.
You're being very careless about this.
More importantly, how did you survive?
How is your backbone?
And that contract you were talking about...
Good night, Lelouch.
Fukushima, Kouchi, Hiroshima.
This makes it seven incidences since Zero appeared.
After Zero appeared, other groups apparently became more hard-working.
Because of that "orange" incident, substitute supervisor Jeremiah has lost his leadership.
He doesn't have the ability to do it.
Thanks to that, the cooperation with the police and unions are in shambles.
It's quite an inconvenience for us as well.
Lend us your strength, Toudou!
Thanks to Zero, Britannia is in a state of confusion!
Now is the time that we, the Japan Liberation Front, should make a stand!
Don't rush it!
The information that Kyoto is giving the Crimson Brocade to Zero is not definitive.
If you concentrate on Zero too much, they will pull the rug out from under you!
Hey, in the end, what did "orange" mean?
What?
You won't answer anyone's questions at all, but you'll ask me questions, huh?
If you don't want to answer me, then you don't have to.
Just like me.
"Orange" was just a casual remark.
But...
There are those who will want it to mean something and will start to analyze it.
The entire world is searching for you.
The entire world is moving because of you.
Lelouch, is this what you wanted to see?
No, this disturbance is merely part of the calculation.
The world will plunge into an even greater chaos.
Private Kururugi Suzaku of the district 11 military, case 1075, concerning the suspicion of Prince Clovis' murder.
We declare you acquitted due to lack of evidence.
Why... all of a sudden?
Please get out of the way!
Look out!
Um... are you injured, or something?
I'm sorry!
I didn't think there would be anyone below.
Oh... no...
I didn't think that a girl would be falling from above either.
Oh?
Is... something wrong?
Yes!
Something is wrong!
Eh?
To tell you the truth, I'm being chased by bad people.
So, can you please help me?
We cannot allow that "orange" to affect Princess Cornelia's arrival.
At this rate, the loyalty of us, the Purists, will be questioned.
Is that true?
That Sir Jeremiah is wild...
Then what is "orange"?
At any rate, it's a fact that Sir Jeremiah is guilty.
Saying that he does not remember anything... it's the same excuse as Patre!
Sir Jeremiah's memories are jumbled.
It's the same with those who had their Sutherlands stolen in Shinjuku.
And...
I haven't introduced myself yet, have I?
I am...
Yuffie.
Yuffie?
Yes.
I am...
You shouldn't do that.
You're famous.
The son of former Captain Kururugi, Private Kururugi Suzaku.
It was a lie, right?
The story about being chased by bad people.
Meow.
Meow meow?
Are you hurt, meow?
Meow meow meow~
Meow?
Meow~
Meow meow?
Meow?
Oh my.
We're late, I hope he's waiting for us.
But was he really acquitted?
Apparently on lack of evidence.
Well, it looks like he was thoroughly investigated, thanks to that incident with Zero...
Oh, why...?
Huh?
Do you dislike cats?
Well, I like them, but...
It appears to be a one-sided love.
Kind people are the ones who have one-sided loves.
It ran off.
Yuffie?
Why did you lie just now?
Are you concerned about me?
Eh?
Uh, yes.
Well then, please come with me for a little bit!
When we're like this, it doesn't seem too different from being in Britannia.
You're from the motherland, Yuffie?
Yes!
I was a student up until last week.
Until last week? Then, what are you now?
By student, do you mean a high-schooler?
You can go sightseeing whenever you want, right?
You ask a lot questions, don't you?
Oh, sorry.
Ah, no, that's not what I meant...
Um... today is my last day off, so I wanted to see what sort of place Area 11 is.
Then it didn't have to be me...
No, I'm glad it was you.
Oh, I see...
Suzaku-san, could you take me to one more place?
You may request anything of me, princess.
Then to Shinjuku...
Please show me Shinjuku, Kururugi Suzaku-san.
Lelouch-kun.
Are you busy right now?
Hm?
What is it?
It's about that phone call from before.
Phone call?
Um... you know, that time in the bathroom...
Ahh.
Do you know if there are call logs?
I want to contact that person.
It's the school's phone, so I don't think...
I see...
I thought so too...
That woman...
What?
What's wrong- whoa!
No way...
Hey...
Hm?
What are you doing?
Ah, what indeed...
To return to the motherland like this...
I shouldn't have gotten involved with that woman...
Are you an idiot?
Don't just go wandering around!
I'm okay as long as I'm within the school grounds.
Don't be so strict.
No, you're an outsider here.
I'm an outsider no matter where I go.
What's with that person?
Oh.
So she's at it again today.
Again today?
I placed a Geass on her which makes her carve a symbol on this wall every day.
Geass?
This power.
During the contract, that's what I heard.
A test to find out the length of duration, huh?
It's best to understand the specs of your weapon, isn't it?
If you're too uncontrollable, then...
I wonder if it would work on me?
Don't worry.
You and I are accomplices.
I won't do anything that would put us in a disadvantegous situation.
The Shinjuku ghetto is finished.
People had finally begun to return, but...
Aw...
As I thought, they won't use the RG's against Elevens.
Hey, over here.
It's the aftermath.
Hurry up and take the picture!
I know!
Take a picture of me next!
Me too!
Is that true?
The information about Zero.
Yes, it is information from Sir Curel.
All right.
Put a cordon on the 4th Zone of the Shinjuku Ghetto.
Understood, Sir.
Sir Curel... we will leave the rest up to you.
I wanted you to contact Sir Jeremiah, but it seems you probably won't, isn't that right?
Get out of here, you Britannian pigs!
Stay here!
Wh-What?
You're just an Eleven!
We're Japanese!
Don't call us Elevens!
What are you saying?
You guys lost to us, you dogs of a defeated country!
Why you Britannian...
Please stop!
Don't resort to violence!
Don't get in the way!
This guy...
You... are you Kururugi Suzaku?
Kururugi, the guy who killed Clovis?
You idiot!
The one who did it was Zero!
This guy is just a slave.
So what if he's an honored Britannian?
Acting so happy...
Selling your pride, comrades and soul...
Are you even Japanese?
!
That's not it!
I...
That IS it!
You dog of Britannia!
Please stop!
I'm an individual who has received training.
Don't fight with your comrades anymore...
What do you mean by comrade? !
Hey!
Let it go.
That traitor...
Suzaku!
Are you all right?
Yes.
It's not okay!
My Prime G and MX 4 are...
You were too late!
Jeez, for being honored...
Why did you let them go?
!
You should have finished them off!
You've killed many Elevens before anyway, haven't you?
Who do you think is feeding you?
I will not allow you to insult this man any further!
In order to use the Geass, one must look directly into the opponents' eyes.
There is no problem penetrating through glasses.
Maximum distance is about 270 meters.
After having the Geass cast on them, or when it's in effect, there is a noticeable gap in memory.
This is thought to be damage caused by the Geass invading the cerebrum.
If it has the property of light, then reflection is also possible.
You sure have studied it a lot in such a short amount of time.
The opponent is an empire which has subdued over a third of the world.
There is no such thing as exercising too much discretion.
Understandable for Elevens, but you're Britannian, aren't you?
Britannia is much too large and powerful of an opponent to fight with just one Geass.
So everything would be okay if I were strong?
I wonder if it's bad to be weak.
At that time... for us 10 year olds, the world appeared to be a very sad place.
Fear.
Sickness.
Corruption.
Decay.
Discrimination.
War and terrorism.
The repeated chain of hatred.
A foolish vicious cycle.
Someone must break this chain asunder.
Quite an idealist.
Of course, I don't think that it is possible to get rid of all of that.
I'm not that arrogant.
That's why...
I would at least like a world without war.
A place where we won't lose dear ones.
Such a convenient world...
What can you do to...
It's easy.
If someone wins, the fighting will end.
Someone?
I don't know yet.
But if I stop aiming for something, my father will have died in vain.
Captain Kururugi's...?
In that war, my father HAD to die!
Jeremiah!
Today, we will make you pay for the sin of allowing the murderer of Prince Clovis to escape!
Cowardly Curel!
So the information that you found Zero was a lie!
Before Princess Cornelia arrives, we must cleanse the shame of our fellow men!
Jeremiah, this is a purge!
Suzaku-kun!
Cecil-san!
It's dangerous here!
Get on!
The Purists are having an internal conflict.
Let's hurry up and get out of here.
Oh, and sorry about interrupting your little get together.
You'll have to do it another time.
Please wait!
Wouldn't this be a good chance to get battle data on the Lancelot?
Eh?
Suzaku...
Sorry, Yuffie... we must bid farewell to each other here.
I have to go.
If I have Lancelot, I should be able to stop them.
So!
Dammit... four on one...
Cowards!
Don't worry, Jeremiah.
We'll treat you like a warrior.
There will be no shame to your family name!
Are you serious?
Are you seriously going to kill me, Curel?
!
Be silent, "orange"!
Why do you think we exist?
!
It's for the Imperial House, is it not? !
All hail Britannia!
Please stop!
Don't fight amongst yourselves as Britannians!
That's... the honored Britannian...
The Collaborative Weapon, Lancelot!
What does a special envoy want?
If you are going to interfere, we'll kill you regardless of who you are!
No!
I can't allow a meaningless fight to go on!
MVS stands for Maser Vibration Swords. MVS?
!
So they were already implemented...
But, I'm not backing down!
Among your own allies...
He's going to save me?
Kururugi Suzaku is...?
Even if I can just take out "orange"...
Sir Jeremiah!
Is that Viletta?
Thanks!
Do you still plan on fighting?
Everyone back off.
Curel...
So we've come to an understanding?
I'll use the Chaos Bomb.
Eh?
Stop!
What?
That honored Britannian... Using his own body as a shield...
Both sides, lower your weapons!
I will command you in my name!
I-It cannot be...
I am the 3rd Imperial Princess of Britannia, Euphemia le Britannia!
Eh...
Yuffie...?
I will take control of this area.
Stand down!
As I thought... the Imperial Princess...
Did you know that, Lloyd-san?
Yeah.
She rarely appeared to the public because she was a student.
I-I am truly...
I am truly sorry!
Imperial Princess!
Eh?
On top of me not even being aware, I have been acting extremely rude to you.
Suzaku...
Just as you lost your father, I have lost my older brother, Clovis.
Will you lend me your strength so that others can get by without losing their loved ones?
Yes!
Your kind words are more than I am worthy of!
I heard about it, Euphemia.
Don't do such reckless things.
I'm sorry, sister.
However...
While we are here, call me Governor-General, Vice-Governor Euphemia.
A distinction is needed precisely because we are true siblings.
Yes, I understand.
Also, concerning the measures being taken...
Yes, the preparations for the welcoming of the Imperial Princess are being readied in the government office...
You are lacking.
You are weak.
You are being sluggish.
What of Zero?
Capture the enemy of the empire's people!
Zero!
Eh?
From today on, I will be a student at Ashford Academy.
I'm Kururugi Suzaku.
Pleased to meet you.
Yeah, I know.
I'm lying.
To Shirley and Rival...
Even to Suzaku and Nanali.
But...
I can't go back...
I can't return.
If C.C. is my accomplice, then I have to use that.
Because I don't want to lie to myself any longer.
The specially administrated zone of Nippon...
There are some unpleasant rumors now spreading about Princess Euphemia over this.
right?
That's where she made contact with Zero.
I think there may be some connection with the top level.
There's none.
The viceroy wasn't the only one asking what was going on.
our connections with them must be... we'll have to sever ties at once.
Too late.
Vice-Minister.
The profit-sharing bribes from the N.A.C.
I appreciate this.
With this... we can finally sweep away the parasites who were sucking Prince Clovis dry.
More rats than expected are confused... aren't they?
Over twenty thousand people have applied to join the Nippon special zone.
that number's just going to grow.
Thanks to you. everyone believes in what we're doing here.
Princess.
I'm thankful for this. Truly thankful.
As I am to you.
I hope you'll help me with everything that's still to come.
Your...
Please.
Yes.

was personally proposed by Her Highness Princess Euphemia.
It cannot be dismissed that this novel idea... is connected to the princess being a student a short while ago.
then even I have to... isn't she?
Now the terror groups in Area 11 will lose their popular support and fall apart.
Public order will be stabilized.
I personally oppose this.
correct?
To ensure public policy stays on track.
It's an obvious measure for a viceroy to take.
Hmm...
Did you accept Euphy's future from the standpoint of a public official as well?
The Nippon special zone...
It doesn't sound that bad.
Will the Japan they hand over have any value?
This concession came as a result of our resistance activities.
There's no shame in it.
Master Kirihara! Did I hear correctly that you were promised a position... in the special zone involving the Sakuradite mining rights?
Nothing to be suspicious of.
It's just a request to participate in the ceremony.
Clever excuse...
How dare you...
And Zero?
What about the Black Knights?
The situation's serious!
It's not just supporters. Some of our own members have applied to the special zone!
there's no risk in joining the Nippon special zone. it's clear which one is more appealing.
too.
What's up with that?
! Probably 'cuz they're offering equality.
Equality my ass!
We can't just take their word for it!
I agree.
But unless we decide how to respond to this quickly...
You want to apply to the special zone?
There it won't matter who's Britannian and who's an Eleven. right?
can we trust their promises?
does it?
that's... they'll force us to disarm.
isn't it?
And we'll get swallowed up in their regime and lose our independence.
we become the enemies of freedom and equality.
Then first we have to support it!
Without any guarantees?
either!
Sorry about having you drop me off like this.
you helped me stock up on food and I heard you were meeting up with Shirley.
too.
Everyone's getting panicky about this special zone starting.
soon.
I don't care about your "special zone!" I don't care about "support!
I'd sooner die than sign that!
dear.
It's Mr. Nobleman.
now? !
The lower classes should just obey their betters without any back talk!
There it is. That's the true nature of the sub-viceroy's "benevolence.
What do you want?
doesn't it?
student.
Back off.
You should be the one who has to go home
you're right.
I'll be leaving now.
what did you say?
Come back at once!
Mr. Nobleman?
Don't mistake borrowed power for your own ability!
Garbage like you should just die where no one can... let's break this up.
Mister?
Insolent whelp! Why should I?
!
Um...
Thank you very much.
it was nothing.
even though he's Zero!
Or... Because he's Zero?
why was he talking with Princess Euphemia?
it'll be dangerous.
as it's known among the terrorists.
why don't you break up your group and leave Mt. Fuji?
we can talk about a legal deal.
your support to the Black Knights will end.
Whether Zero comes or not tomorrow doesn't matter. that man's defeat is assured.
I'm home.
big brother.
Where's Shirley?
either.
huh?
You seem sort of cold towards her lately.
You think so?
I'll consider that.
please?
as you wish.
Are you worried about something?
Is it about Euphy?
I won't be selfish and say I want to see her again.
It would just cause trouble for you and Euphy.
don't you?
the same way you like her.
Yeah...
I did like her.
This is the stadium for the inaugural ceremony for the specially administrated zone of Nippon.
I mean with Japanese.
Many Japanese who could not get inside are gathered outside.
do you think Zero will show up here?
he's apparently made no contact at this point in time.
1015)}CHINESE FEDERATION EXECUTIVE CONFERENCE CHAMBER
500)}E.U. CENTRAL COUNCIL CHAMBER
it's time.
Right.
Zero.
It's Zero!
Zero's appeared!
He came after all!
You accept that you've lost?
What are you planning?
! I thought I would have to carry your identity with me to the grave!
it's all over!
They'll mistake this for a farce planned by the Britannians!
It'll be the end of this specially administrated zone!
kill him at once!
My Lord!
Zero!
Welcome to the specially administrated zone of Nippon!
Euphemia li Britannia!
I sincerely wish to speak with you!
With me?
Yes! With you alone!
ladies and gentlemen!
Zero has boldly appeared!
he is moving toward G1.
I knew we should have gone there.
What choice did we have?
Zero wouldn't show.
There doesn't seem to be any obvious problem.
please.
it's dangerous to be alone with this man!
At least let me come with you!
just trust me.
how long are we supposed to hang around here?
Wasn't having Zero tell us to wait here enough for you?
but...
Everything starts after we confirm the Britannian's real intentions.
Deputy-commander?
Hm? Yes?
hasn't he?
It's dangerous to draw conclusions.
He's even having Diethard and Rakshata standing by.
I think he may be planning to kill Euphemia... aren't you?
Even though the cameras are off.
I'm afraid.
made from ceramic and bamboo.
It can't be picked up on a detector.
would you?
I wouldn't.
Euphy.
leaving her alone with Zero?
But she ordered us!
There's an emergency call button she can press.
What's wrong?
What are you doing with Zero? !
It looks like he can see me.
Is it because of our indirect contact and what happened at Kamine Island?
then...
CODE GEASS Lelouch of the Rebellion
This ceremony is being broadcast worldwide.
shoot Zero.
What do you think will happen then? I imagine.
Right. and your popularity will crash to the Earth.
What kind of nonsense are you saying?
Help me rebuild Japan... you're being just as bad as Clovis was!
All conditions for this situation have been cleared.
Zero will be cheered when he makes a miraculous recovery.
People don't care about reason. But they can't resist a good miracle.
take the gun.
There can be only one messiah.
the people will...
I... I thought so!
Just tell me one thing!
No...
He's reached that point? ! Hey!
Maj. Kururugi!
you! What have you done?
Lelouch!
Stop it!
Stop giving me your pity!
I won't take your charity!
I have to try and achieve this on my own!
Euphemia li Britannia!
I've given up that name! but I've given up my claim to the throne!
is it?
right?
isn't it?
I suppose you did it for my sake.
I see.
I did it for Nunnally!
I don't need anything else.
And that's why you?
! And that's what made up my mind.
It made me consider what was truly important to me.
Lelouch? I'm not giving up anything that's truly important to me.
And don't worry! I won't tell anyone about you!
And Cornelia?
It's not like we'll never see each other again.
You're a fool.
An amazing fool.
but... you ended up winning it all. you were always just plain little Euphy.
Then will you do this with plain little Euphy?
You... You are the worst enemy I ever faced.
You win.
Let's figure out a better use for this special zone of yours.
all right?
do you?
Did you really think you could get me to shoot you just by threatening me?
that's not it.
no one can resist.
any order at all.
you're just being silly now.
it wouldn't matter how you felt about it...
I don't...
I don't want to kill them!
No!
Did I?
You're right. I have to kill the Japanese.
I've become like Mao!
I can't control my Geass now!
Forget the order I just gave you!
wait! so I'll be returning to the homeland today.
Then we should keep the experimental adapted organism here?
Right. How's his intelligence look?
There's only so much we can do here in Area 11.
I see.
We should ask the Rosenberg Institute about that.
Can you send him and the test unit over there after I make arrangements there?
Your Highness.
That just leaves the Kamine Island ruins...
It'll have to wait till the security situation in Area 11 has stabilized.
We have the specially administrated zone to thank for that.
it looks like everything's going to work out perfectly.
where's Zero?
!
All of you who call yourselves Japanese... please?
What did she just say?
No way... right?
Suzaku!
He's just unconscious.
But why? !
Umm... can you?
please kill them all.
Wipe them out!
She's serious?
! Cut the mics and cameras!
no!
Halt! Out of my way!
Damn terrorist!
Stand aside!
soldiers! Hurry!
Princess Euphemia!
What's come over you?
! please!
This is...
General!
but I have to kill all the Japanese.
all Britannians!
exterminate the Elevens!
Don't let one escape!
Stop it!
What are you doing?
! Knight of Honor of the Britannian Forces!
Cease fire at once!
We were ordered to kill all the Japanese here.
Princess Euphemia ordered it personally.
What?
Princess Euphemia did?
Don't be ridiculous!
aren't you?
What's happening?
! What happened in there?
! Gun fire?
It can't be.
What does the TV say?
They cut the feed!
STOP!
This... My Geass did this?
! Z - Zero...
Help us...
Japan's... savior...
Don't force me... too?
I'm not your savior. I'm not your messiah!
You're... You're our only... hope...
Stop...
Don't...
!
Zero...
What did you do to Princess Euphemia? !
Andreas Darlton...
The closest of Cornelia's close advisors.
What?
! What's happening in the stadium?
! We're figuring that out!
We're getting a feed from the stadium now.
Why can't you cut this off?
! Someone's hacking this in from somewhere!
Stop it!
It's going live to the entire world!
They'll cut the broadcast soon.
Let's upload the data to the Net.
You heard him!
Right.
Sir!
C.C. has made contact with the supreme commander!
cleared.
Zero.
I'm shocked. I didn't think you'd go this far.
It wasn't me.
What?
I didn't use my Geass.
I didn't mean to use it!
what I felt before was...
I made my contract with you.
You told me how dangerous this power was.
And yet!
He did it! He really did it!
- What is this? !
wait!
Don't follow me unless you're coming along!
Euphy!
Have you found her? !
Where is she? !
either!
Something's wrong.
This isn't like Euphemia at all.
but we can't be connected with Kirihara now!
we need to save ourselves.
Indeed.
Is the "souvenir" ready?
How pathetic... we value ourselves above others.
Lady Sumeragi.
as well.
And what's the point if we're the only ones left? !
Kaguya!
You only have your family's name backing you!
what's the point of Kyoto's existence? !
I can't believe Euphy would order all those people to be exterminated!
somehow!
Hey! The Britannian forces have left the stadium!
Right.
our only option is to exploit Euphemia to the utmost.
It's the least we can do!
Zero! Return that unit! That machine is the property of our military...
This is an order to all Black Knights!
Euphemia has become our enemy!
The specially administrated zone of Nippon is a cowardly trap to lure us in!
break into the ceremony grounds!
Wipe out all Britannian forces! Save the Japanese!
Hurry!
I have to!
I have to find Euphy!
Find her and kill her!

Who was it that created this situation?
Who is it that bears the sin for this tragedy?
Who is it that desires this battle?
! And who is it that the world belongs to?
I understand.
I!
I want you to help me understand what made Western civilization dominate the world for the Iast 500 years.
Why did the West dominate the rest?
Shakir?
- First of all, they had guns.
- Guns?
And everyone else had bows and arrows.
They had the attitude that they should probably get on boats - and go and invade other countries.
- exploration.
Getting in boats.
NIALL FERGUSON: Around 500 years ago, a band of intrepid sailors and soldiers from the petty warring kingdoms of medieval Europe changed the world.
Thirsting after conquest, commerce, colonisation and conversion, they exported their civilization from their little nook of Western Eurasia to every corner of the globe.
Before long, Western civilization became the world's dominant civilization.
The West taught the rest its way of doing business... its scientific method... its law and its politics, its way of dressing... of speaking and of praying.
The big story is that after 1500, the West essentially dominated the rest.
And it's a story we ignore at our peril, because today, after half a millennium of tilting westwards, the world seems inexorably to be tilting to the East.
China's pot is to become the world's biggest economy.
islam could soon overtake Christianity as mankind's favourite faith.
So, does all this mean that Western civilization itself could soon be history?
The only way to answer that question is to understand how the West came to be so powerful in the first place.
The thing of education.
If you've got the right education...
The amount of land that a country controls.
With trade, with the introduction of trade... NIALL:
I think we could simplify it.
I have boiled it down to six things and I'm going to call them the six killer applications - the killer apps - that made the West dominate the rest.
The first one is competition.
Number two killer app is science.
Democracy, medicine, consumerism.
The work ethic, which you obviously all have.
Understanding how the West beat the rest gives us an insight not just into the past but also into the future, and I think you'II agree, it helps answer the question that could be the most important of our time.
Are we the generation on whose watch Western ascendancy is going to end?
We tend to assume that our civilization, the one that's dominated the world for so long, will last for ever.
It's easy to forget that Western civilization has declined and fallen once before.
The ancient Roman ruins here at Caesarea in israel are a pretty potent reminder of that.
In the space of just a generation, in the fifth century AD, the Roman Empire in Western Europe essentially fell apart - the aqueducts dried up, the roads overgrown, the circuses deserted.
Question - could something similar happen to Western civilization 2.0 - the version that, after a millennium of stagnation, rose to dominate the world?
Beset by economic crises and by environmental fears, the West today is also waking up to a growing Eastern challenge to its political and military supremacy.
The evidence is here in China.
The biggest and fastest industrial revolution ever, compressed into just 30 years.
A self-confident one-party state.
A culture reasserting itself on the world stage.
The ascent of China looks like being the defining political event of the 21 st century.
It's almost as if the clock is being wound back 600 years, to the last time China led the world.
The Forbidden City in Beijing.
Built by the Ming dynasty in the early 1 5th century, these awe-inspiring buildings are a reminder of the last time China was a global leader.
They remain as relics of one of the greatest civilizations in all history.
But they're also a reminder that no civilization lasts for ever.
Within a century of their construction, the decline of the East and the rise of the West had begun.
500 years ago, something quite extraordinary happened.
The impoverished, petty, strife-torn kingdoms of Western Europe embarked on five centuries of uninterrupted expansion.
meanwhile, the magnificent empires of the Orient, exemplified by Beijing's Forbidden City, stagnated and then succumbed to Western dominance.
By 1900, if not earlier, the Westerners had effectively subjugated the Resterners.
In 1 500, Western Europe had accounted for only 1 0% of the world's land surface and, at most, 1 6% of its population.
By 1 91 3, 1 1 Western empires controlled more than half of all territory and population and a staggering 80% of global economic output.
As recently as the 1 980s, the average American was 7 0 times richer than the average Chinese.
We tend to assume that it was Western technology that trumped the East... in particular, the technology that went on to produce the industrial Revolution.
But it wasn't that.
The real killer app that the West had and the rest lacked was competition, both political and economic.
And the consequences - the birth of the nation-state and the rise of capitalism - would lead to a remarkable reversal of fortunes.
This is history's greatest revelation - how it was that Europeans, not Chinese, came to run the world.
What would you have seen if you'd taken two trips along two rivers in the year 1 420?
The Thames and the Yangtze.
The Yangtze was part of a vast waterway known as the Grand Canal that linked Hangzhou with Beijing 1,000 miles to the north.
The restoration and improvement of the canal was part of a plan to stimulate China's economy, masterminded by the formidable Ming emperor known as Yongle.
This is the Precious belt Bridge at Suzhou, with its 53 arches, one of the architectural marvels of the Grand canal.
In the reign of Emperor YongIe, which means, literally, "perpetual happiness", 15,000 barges used to sail up and down it every year.
Venice, eat your heart out.
When the intrepid Venetian Marco Polo had visited China in the 1 27 0s, he'd been astonished by the volume of traffic on the Yangtze.
"The multitude of vessels that invest this river is so great "that no-one who should read or hear would believe it.
"The quantity of merchandise carried up and down is past all belief.
"ln fact, it is so big, that it seems to be a sea rather than a river. "
400 miles upstream from the South China Sea,
Yongle controlled his vast empire from the Imperial capital, Nanjing.
With a population of up to a million, the city was probably the largest in the world.
YongIe didn't believe in doing anything by halves.
This is just one volume of the vast encyclopaedia of Chinese literature and learning which he commissioned.
There were 1 1 ,095 volumes in total, and it was compiled by a team of 2,000 scholars.
It was surpassed as the world's largest encyclopaedia only in 2007, after a reign of 600 years... by Wikipedia.
But Yongle was not content with Nanjing.
He resolved to build a new and more spectacular capital to the north, in Beijing.
By 1 420, when the Forbidden City was at last complete,
Ming China had an incontrovertible claim to be the most advanced civilization in the world.
It really did seem as if the Emperor Yongle ruled over "All Under Heaven".
Contrast Yongle's realm with that of his contemporaries,
Richard ll or Henry V.
They ruled over a land that was in some ways still mired in the Dark Ages.
Its mightiest river, the Thames, was, let's be frank, a primitive backwater.
Yes, I know we're taught to think of Henry V as one of the great heroes of english history, but I'm afraid his kingdom was very far from the "sceptred isle"
of Shakespeare's famous play.
More like a septic isle.
There were, of course, some imposing sights on the banks of the Thames, notably a large gaol, the Tower of London.
But a visitor from Nanjing would scarcely have been impressed.
The Tower of London was a pretty primitive edifice compared with the splendours of the great towers of imperial China.
London's old, patched-up city walls extended a paltry three miles.
By contrast, it took the founder of the Ming dynasty 21 years to build a wall more than 20 miles long around his capital city, Nanjing.
The gate where I'm sitting could house more than 3,000 soldiers.
And as you can see, this was serious bricks and mortar, built to last.
By 1 5th-century standards, Nanjing was a pretty pleasant place to live.
London wasn't.
The ravages of the Black Death, the bubonic plague that had devastated Europe in the early 1 4th century, had reduced the city's population to around 40,000, less than a 20th the size of Nanjing's.
English life expectancy at birth was a miserable 37 years.
Henry V himself became King at the age of 26, and was dead from dysentery by 35 - a reminder, by the way, that most history is made by young people.
The ones that survived, that is.
Roughly one in five English children died in the first year of life.
In London, the figure was nearly one in three.
Violence was endemic.
When not fighting the French, the English fought the Welsh, the Scots and the Irish... or themselves.
Between 1 330 and 1 479, a quarter of deaths in the English aristocracy were violent.
Life in this period really was, as Thomas Hobbes famously said,
"solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short".
It was also incredibly unhygienic by oriental standards.
Without any proper sewage system, medieval London stank to high heaven, whereas human excrement was routinely collected in Chinese cities and spread on outlying fields.
When he was Lord Mayor of London, which was four times between 1397 and his death in 1 423,
Dick Whittington had to watch where he put his feet, because the streets of his city were paved with something very different from gold.
And England was probably the most prosperous European country.
Life was even nastier, more brutal and shorter in France.
No, 600 years ago, the idea of a civilized West would have seemed absurd.
The future of humanity surely lay in the East.
But why was the East so far ahead?
Long before the industrial Revolution came to England, China was amazingly inventive.
You probably thought Jethro tull, the english agricultural pioneer, invented the seed drill.
But no, the Chinese got there 2,000 years ago.
In fact, before 1 400, there was a veritable alphabet of Chinese inventions.
Astronomical observatories.
Card games.
The clock.
This is the biggest water clock in China.
Now, it's not really clear if the Egyptians, the babylonians or the Chinese invented the water clock.
But it was utterly transformed in 1 086 by the great Chinese inventor Su Song.
Su Song combined it with a gear-driven escapement to create the world's first mechanical clock.
Nothing remotely so accurate existed in england until the 1 4th century.
Time really did seem to be on China's side.
Football.
Gunpowder.
Ink.
Matches.
Paper.
The printing press.
15th-century Germany?
More like 1 1th-century China.
The suspension bridge.
China, 2,000 years ago.
Not to mention the wheelbarrow.
And that's not all.
As a new century dawned in 1 400, the emperor YongIe had another transport technology at his disposal, which had the potential to make him master, not just of the middle Kingdom, but of the entire global market.
It was time for imperial China to set sail.
Now, that's what I call a ship.
What they're building here in Nanjing is a fuII-scaIe replica of one of the treasure ships of admiral Zheng He - the most famous sailor in Chinese history, the man who very nearly turned the middle Kingdom into a global empire.
By the time they've finished, it'II be 400 feet in length.
That's ten times the size of the Santa Maria, the ship that columbus sailed across the atlantic Ocean in 1 492.
And there wasn't just one of them.
Zheng He set sail in command of a crew of some 28,000 men in a fleet of dozens of these enormous ships.
Zheng He was an unusual man.
Captured in battle at the age of 1 1, he was castrated and assigned as a servant to the man who would seize the Imperial throne as Yongle.
Yongle and Zheng He would become one of the great double acts of Chinese history.
Between 1 405 and 1 424, admiral Zheng He's fleet ranged far and wide.
They sailed to CaIicut, to malacca, to CeyIon, to Sumatra, to Hormuz, to Aden...
Some scholars speculate they reached as far as northern australia, the Cape of Good Hope and greenland, and all this was years before the European Age of exploration had so much as begun.
The main purpose of these visits was not so much to trade, but to assert Chinese supremacy.
Who could refuse to kowtow to an emperor possessed of so mighty a fleet?
In 1 415, Zheng He reached the coast of East Africa.
In a short time, the fleet was loaded up with representatives of 30 different kings and chiefs ready to acknowledge the cosmic ascendancy of the Ming emperor.
Down below were stowed a host of exotic animals.
The sultan of MaIindi chose a giraffe to send.
Yongle personally received the animal at the gateway of the Imperial Palace in Nanjing.
The giraffe was hailed as a symbol of perfect virtue, perfect government and perfect harmony in the empire and the universe.
In many ways, the giraffe perfectly symboIised the zenith of Chinese prestige in the world.
And then, in 1 424, came news that would fundamentally change not only the history of China, but the history of the world itself.
The Emperor YongIe had died, and with him died the dream of Chinese overseas expansion.
Within just a few years, China turned in on itself.
The death of Yongle had an immediate and dramatic impact.
Under his successors, Zheng He's voyages were suspended.
From 1 500, anyone in China found building a ship with more than two masts was liable to the death penalty.
In 1 551, it became a crime even to go to sea on a multi-masted ship.
The records of Zheng He's voyages were destroyed.
The tomb of Emperor YongIe at ChangIing is an appropriate place to reflect on the huge opportunity that China missed.
What lay behind the momentous decision to turn inwards?
Was it fiscal trouble or political wrangles at the imperial court?
Was it because a war in Annam, modern-day Vietnam, turned out to be more expensive than anyone had expected?
Or was it just Confucian suspicion of the so-caIIed strange things that admiral Zheng He had brought home with him?
We may never know.
Like the Apollo moon missions,
Zheng He's voyages were carried out at enormous expense.
They were a formidable demonstration of power and technological sophistication.
But beyond that, to be blunt, they turned out to be pretty pointless.
Landing a Chinese eunuch on the East African coast was essentially the same as landing an American on the moon - pretty impressive.
But so what?
What was important was what you did when you got there.
China's failure to exploit its advantages left the path of overseas expansion wide open for the West.
When the new emperor called home Zheng He's mighty navy, he virtually guaranteed that it wouId be the West's version of civilization that would sweep the globe.
Size isn't everything.
Admiral Zheng He's enormous ships and his emperor's grandiose ambitions had done precious little for China.
How very different it would be for the altogether more modest voyages about to be undertaken by a remarkable man from the tiny little European kingdom of Portugal.
His name was Vasco da Gama.
Da Gama made his country's - and his own - fortune by cornering the market in the 1 5th century's favourite food additive spices.
For centuries, the old spice route ran from the Indian Ocean over land across the Arabian peninsula, into the Ottoman Empire, and then from Venice into Europe.
It was entirely dominated by the Arabs, the Turks and the Venetians.
The Portuguese had the brilliant idea that if they could find an alternative route, all the way around the coast of Africa, round the Cape of Good Hope and into the Indian Ocean... then this business could be theirs.
It was here in the Castle of St George in the hills above Lisbon that the newly crowned Portuguese King Manuel appointed da Gama to command a fleet of ships, to make discoveries and go in search of spices.
King manuel's orders to Vasco da Gama tell us something very important about the overseas spread of Western civilization.
As we'II see, there was more than one killer app, but the one that really started the ball rolling was surely competition - both the main driver of capitalism and of the fragmented European state system.
For Europeans, exploration was the Iate-15th-century space race.
Or rather, spice race.
Da Gama set sail from this spot on 8th july, 1 497.
When he and his fellow sailors rounded the Cape of Good Hope, the southernmost tip of Africa, they weren't wondering, as the Chinese had, if they could find some exotic animals to take home to their king.
They were wondering if they could make money there.
In 1 498, more than 80 years after the Chinese explorer Zheng He had landed at Malindi on the Kenyan coast, Vasco da Gama turned up.
He wasn't here to impress the locals, much less to hunt giraffe.
He immediately saw Malindi's potential as a trading post.
By 1 506, the Portuguese had a near monopoly on shipping along the East African coast.
This wasn't the only difference between the Chinese and the Portuguese.
There was also a streak of ruthlessness, of downright nastiness, about these Portuguese explorers that Zheng He seldom evinced.
The Portuguese knew they were eating someone else's lunch along with their spices.
But they were ready to meet any resistance with cannon fire and cutlass.
This is the tomb of Vasco da Gama here in St Jerome's monastery in Lisbon.
Da Gama died in 1524 of a fever, but that didn't mark the end of Portuguese ambitions.
explorers like him pressed on beyond India, as far as China.
The great reversal of fortunes was now unstoppable.
Along with Portugal, Spain had been first off the mark, seizing the initiative in the New World.
The Dutch weren't far behind, building up a hugely profitable trading company by following the spice route to Indonesia.
They, in turn, were closely followed by the French.
And what of the english, whose territorial ambitions had once extended no further than France and whose one big economic idea had been to sell wool to the italians?
How could they possibly sit on the sidelines with news coming in that their archenemies, the Spaniards, were making a killing overseas?
By the 1 7th century, the Thames was no longer a provincial backwater.
It was the hub of Britain's burgeoning overseas empire.
The docks at Deptford were producing ocean-going ships by the dozen.
In 1 635, the first English merchantman arrived in Chinese waters.
Once, when Zheng He had sailed the high seas, China had been able to regard distant Europeans with indifference, if not contempt.
Now trading rivalry had brought the barbarians to China.
And with each new trading post, each new warehouse, each new fort,
Western civilization uploaded its unique killer app of commercial competition.
The question is, why did the Europeans have that fervour when the Chinese didn't?
Why was Vasco da Gama so clearly hungry for money - hungry enough to kill for it?
well, you can find the answer here in the bowels of the British Library by looking at wonderful old maps like this one, which is of the city-state of Lubeck, dating back to 1530.
It's just one long - very long - celebration of local autonomy.
And it was a pattern repeated throughout Europe.
In Venice, La Serenissima, here in Frankfurt, on the banks of the River Main... and, of course, in London itself. It wasn't just London pride.
AII the great European cities were proud of their own autonomy.
I can't help feeling the message of these maps is "divide and rule", except that it was by being divided that the Europeans ended up ruling the rest of the world.
small was beautiful in the middle Ages, because smaIIness meant competition.
Competition between states and, within states, between companies.
Compare that with China, with its one monolithic empire.
Whereas in China power was centralised in the hands of the emperor, in Northern Europe particularly, there was an astonishing decentralisation.
Hundreds of states and city-states competing against each other.
In England, the most important commercial centre in the country was almost completely autonomous.
The City of London Corporation can trace its origins back to the 12th century.
That means that the lord mayor, the sheriffs, the city council, the freemen, the Iiverymen and the aldermen are all more than 800 years old, making this the world's oldest autonomous commercial institution.
In many ways, it's the forerunner of today's multinational corporations.
In other ways, it's the forerunner of democracy itself.
The City was never in awe of the Crown, and the wealthier the City became, the more leverage it had.
Loans to the Crown became the key to urban autonomy.
And the masters of the medieval universe were the livery companies.
And that's where power used to lie - with the drapers, the goldsmiths, the grocers, the haberdashers, ironmongers, mercers, the saIters, the shearers, the skinners - not forgetting the tailors and the vintners.
Dating back to the middle Ages, they're a reminder of the amazing power - economic and political - that used to be wielded by London's craftsmen and merchants.
And craftsmanship brings us back to that great Chinese invention the clock.
So this was the cutting edge of timekeeping technology. Yes, totally correct.
No-one else in the world could match the skills or abilities of the english cIockmaker.
There's no better metaphor for the relentless shift of global power than the clock.
The English mechanical clock was not only more accurate than the Chinese water clock - it was also designed to be sold widely, rather than monopolised by the emperor's astronomers. IAN:
clocks often were made for a story, and this clock,
Nebuchadnezzar is sleeping in the Ieft-hand corner of the screen... - NIALL: Oh, yes.
- IAN: ...and he's having a dream.
The axeman is chopping the tree of Iife down - and the whole world will come to an end, and we'II all die.
Is this the kind of clock that you sent to foreigners to impress them? That is exactly it.
You're showing off your technology is better than theirs.
The rise of the clock, and later the portable watch, went hand in hand with the rise of Europe and the spread of Western civilization.
And with every new individual timepiece, a little bit more time ran out for the age of oriental predominance.
While Europe was a patchwork quilt,
China remained a vast monochrome blanket.
Not even the most pretentious European court could match the Ming dynasty's authority.
The Forbidden City in Beijing is just one vast monument to the unity of Imperial power.
Just take a walk from the Protecting Harmony hall to the middle Harmony hall, where the emperor had his private quarters, to the hall of Supreme Harmony, where the Dragon Throne itself sat. Harmony, harmony, harmony.
It's a kind of codeword for unity, for undivided imperial authority.
This simply had no counterpart among the fractured and competing states and cities of 1 5th-century Europe.
In China, Imperial rule was implemented by a Confucian bureaucracy, recruited on the basis of perhaps the most terrifying set of exam papers in all history.
This photograph is of the central examination compound in Nanjing.
Thousands of wannabe mandarins would be locked in these cells, just three-and-a-half feet deep, about the same width, and only five-and-a-half feet high.
During the time an examination lasted, the only movement allowed was the passage of servants, replenishing food and water supplies, or removing human waste.
Some candidates went completely insane under the pressure.
No doubt after nine long days shut in a shoebox, it was the most able, and the certainly most indefatigable, candidates who passed the imperial examination.
But this was an exam that rewarded caution, even conformity.
It was competitive, certainly, but not the kind of competition that fosters innovation, much less the appetite for change.
Confucius said, among other things, that,
"The common man marvels at uncommon things.
"The wise man marvels at the commonplace."
But maybe there was just a bit too much that was commonplace about the way that Ming China was governed.
And in a world that refused to stand still, that was a recipe for trouble. Big trouble.
(GONG)
Great empires are complex things.
For centuries they can bask in a sweet spot of power and prosperity.
But then, often quite suddenly, they can collapse.
Let's look again at what happened to Imperial China.
The Ming dynasty had been born in 1 368, and as we've seen, for more than a century after that,
Ming China was the world's most sophisticated civilization by almost any measure.
But then, in the mid-1 7th century, the wheels came flying off.
Political factionalism, fiscal crisis and famine opened the door to rebellion and invasion.
The results were devastating.
Conflict and disease reduced the Chinese population by as much as 40%.
In 1 644, the last Ming emperor hanged himself out of shame.
This dramatic transition from Confucian equipoise to anarchy had taken little more than a decade.
What had gone wrong?
well, the answer is that turning inwards proved fatal for a complex and densely populated society like China's.
The Ming system had created a kind of high-equiIibrium trap.
OutwardIy it was very impressive, but on the inside it was highly fragile.
The least little thing caused the trap to snap shut because there were no external resources to draw on.
And that explains why Zheng He, the personification of early Chinese expansionism, for so long forgotten, is a hero in today's newly gIobaIised China.
In the words of China's great economic reformer of the 1 980s,
Deng Xiaoping, "No country that wishes to become developed today "can pursue closed-door policies.
"When Zheng He sailed the Western Ocean, our country was open.
"After Yongle died, the dynasty went into decline "and became backward and mired in darkness and ignorance. "
That's a plausible reading of history.
As England's population growth accelerated in the late 1 7th century, trade brought an influx of new nutrients like potatoes and sugar, while colonisation allowed the emigration of surplus people.
Over time, the effect was to raise productivity, incomes, nutrition and even height.
In contrast, by turning away from foreign trade and intensifying rice cultivation, the Chinese were stuck with rising population, falling incomes and declining nutrition, height and productivity.
The English got better stimulants, too.
They got the coffee house while the Chinese got the opium den.
In 1 793, the 1 st Earl Macartney led an expedition to the Qianlong Emperor, in a vain effort to persuade the Chinese to re-open their empire to trade.
Macartney brought with him ample tribute the most advanced scientific instruments, including the finest clocks that England could make.
As he later wrote,
"The emperor and his minions were unimpressed.
"lt was discovered that the taste for science, "if it ever existed, was now completely worn out.
"This intricate workmanship was all lost "and thrown away on the ignorant Chinese. "
Unrepentant in his isolation, the emperor addressed a dismissive message to King George lll.
"There is nothing we lack.
"We have never set much store on strange or ingenious objects. "
Except maybe those nice English clocksl I'm standing here in the heart of the Forbidden City entirely surrounded by clocks.
It's just that all these clocks were either manufactured by or designed by EngIishmen.
Nothing could better symboIise the transition of power from East to West.
The Chinese had invented the mechanical clock, but now the imperial court was reduced to accepting superior timepieces as gifts from Europeans.
And when they broke down, the Chinese couldn't even mend them.
The West's ascendancy was perfectly symbolised in June 1 842, when British ships sailed up the Yangtze to the Grand Canal in retaliation for the destruction of opium by a zealous Chinese official.
China had to pay an indemnity of 21 million silver dollars, cede the island of Hong Kong, and open five ports to British trade, including this one.
This is one of the great outposts of British penetration of Asia - the Shanghai Bund.
The old headquarters of the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank used to be described as the most luxurious building between the Suez canal and the Bering Strait.
It was ironic, but perhaps appropriate, that the first "unequal treaty" between Britain and China was signed here at the Jinghai Temple, built by the Emperor Yongle more than four centuries before, in honour of Admiral Zheng He,
master and commander of the last imperial super-ship.
Today, they're building ocean-going ships again in China vast ships capable of bringing back the raw materials necessary to feed China's insatiably growing industrial economy.
Competition, markets, profits, capitalism - these are things that China once turned its back on.
Well, not any more.
I'm standing on a crane in the biggest shipyard in China.
Now, if 30 years ago, you'd predicted that China's would be the second largest economy by 201 1 and the largest by 2030, I think you'd have been dismissed as a fantasist.
But it wouId have seemed equally fantastic in 1 420 to have predicted Western ascendancy.
The point is that in the course of the 15th century,
Europeans discovered the joys of competition, both economic and political.
And in a competition for control of the Asian spice trade, capitalism was born and, with it, the foundation for a world dominated by Western civilization.
The kind of economically driven civilization that today seems to be working rather better in the East.
Yet competition was only one of the killer apps of Western dominance.
In the next episode of civilization, I'll ask why it was that the scientific revolution happened only in the West, and failed to take off even in those parts of the Eastern world that had once been pioneers of mathematics and astronomy.
Why, in short, was there no Isaac Newton in Istanbul?
Long ago, in the Year of Our Lord 326 A.D., a great prophet is leader of the Nephite people in ancient upstate New York.
His name... is Mormon.
I... am Mormon.
My people sailed here from Israel to create a new civilization.
These golden plates tell of our people and how we met with...
Jesus Christ.
I... am Jesus.
Take care of your golden plates, Mormon, for soon, your entire civilization will be gone and nobody will remember you.
Just before the Nephite people were wiped out, Mormon gave the plates to his son, Moroni.
I... am Moroni, the last of my kind.
I shall bury the golden plates, father, and perhaps one day someone very special will find them.
And lo, Moroni buried the golden plates high on a hill.
Centuries later the golden plates were found, giving birth to the fastest-growing religion today!
A church that even now sends missionaries out all over the world!

Two by two, I guess it's you and me We're off to preach across land and sea
Satan has a hold of France!
We need to knock him off his perch!
We are the soldiers of the army of the Church ...of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints!
Elder Cross and Elder Green, you will be serving in...
Japan. Oh, Japan!
Land of soy sauce!
And Mothra!
Elder Harris and Elder Brown.
Heavenly Father, where will I go on my mission
(on my mission)? Will it be China or Old Mexico on my mission?
(mission)
It could be San Fran by the bay, Australia where they say "G'day", but I pray I'm sent to my favorite place:
Orlando (Orlando)
I love you Orlando.
Sea World and Disney and putt putt golfing!
Elder Price.
Yes sir! Your brother will be...
Elder Cunningham.
That's me!
That's me!
Hello!
Oh, hi.
And your mission location is...
Uganda.
Uganda.
Uganda? Cool...
Where is that?
Africa.
Oh boy!
Like Lion King.
Two by two, and now it's time to go
Our paths have been revealed, so let's start the show
Our shirts are clean and pressed and our haircuts are precise
We are the army of the Church We are the army of the Church
We are the army of the Church of Jesus Christ!
Two by two we march to victory
Armed with the greatest book in history
We'll convert everyone all across the planet Earth.
That is the beauty of, the essence of, the purpose of, the mission of the soldiers of the army of the Church of Jesus Christ ...of Latter-Day Saints!
All right, elders, all right!
Go home and pack your things.
Tomorrow, your missions begin.
Bye you guys!
I am so stoked we got paired together, Elder Price.
Oho, me too.
This is... fantastic!
You know what? I prayed to Heavenly Father that we would get paired together.
He really does listen!
He answered your prayers?
Yep, my mom said "if Heavenly Father is proud of you, he'll always give you what you ask."
You and me for two years in Ukuhanda!
This is gonna be awesome!
Yes, well, if we have the Book of Mormon, it'll do those Africans a lot of good.
Well, see you tomorrow, companion.
Tomorrow is a Latter Day!
Goodbye, son. We're so proud of you.
Wow, I can't believe Kevin is going to Africa for two years...
I'm gonna miss my brother so much.
Aw I know. I'm gonna miss you guys too.
Hey, maybe we should see if there's anyway I could get transferred someplace a little bit closer to home, like uh...
Florida, or...
No, don't worry, son. Heavenly Father has a hand in everything.
He knows what's best.
He always knows.
You're right, dad.
I'm sure I'm gonna have an amazing time.
Alright son, just remember: do whatever Elder Price does.
He is a great Mormon, and you, well, you're a... great follower.
Right! I'm a follower.
Elder Price seems like a wonderful boy, Arnold!
Uh... oh, he is. We're gonna have the most amazing time together.
It's like, like I'm finally gonna have a best friend.
Ohoho, well, just remember what we talked about with regards to your little problem.
Oh don't worry Dad, my little problem is "in check." It's not gonna be an issue.
What's the little problem?
Oh, nothing.
He uh ju-, well, he has a very active imagination.
I lie a lot!
No!
It's just he sometimes makes things up when he doesn't know what else to say.
Bishop Donahue said it's because I have no self-esteem and desperately want to fit in with by my peers.
Well alright everybody,
I think it's time we leave these two to their work.
Boy you boys have a lot of catching up to do now that you're companions.
This is it, elders.
You're heading... to Africa.
Well how did you like that, boys? A real Lion King send-off.
We got Mrs. Brown to sing like an African for you.
Thanks, Dad.
That was great!
Well, good luck in Africa, boys! I've never been, But I hear it's a HOOT!
Well, goodbye, son, and please be careful.
Now you get out there and you baptize those Africans, boy!
Bye, Mrs. Brown!
Well? This is you and me now, companion.
Yup, that's right, elder.
From this point on, according to Rule #72, we are never allowed to go anywhere without each other.
Except the bathroom.
Yes, that's right.
This is so awesome!
Because all my friends always end up leaving me, but you can't!
Okay, favorite movies:
Are you a Star Wars guy or are you a Star Trek guy? I wanna know everything about you. Personally I like Star Wars, but I'm willing to like Star Trek if you think it's better?
Okay Elder, uh...
Look, I like to have fun just as much as the next guy, you know, but um, look, things are different now.
We are men. This is our time to prove that we are worthy.
Worthy of what?
Of everything we've been promised in the afterlife
I've always had the hope that on the day I go to heaven
Heavenly Father will shake my hand and say: "You've done an awesome job, Kevin"
Now it's our time to go out-
My best friend -to set the world's people free.
We can do it together, you and me, but mostly me!
You and me, but mostly me Are gonna change the world forever
'Cause I can do most anything
And I can stand next to you and watch
Every hero needs a sidekick Every captain needs a mate
- Every dinner needs a side dish
- On a slightly smaller plate
And now we're seeing eye to eye!
It's so great we can agree That Heavenly Father has chosen you and me Just mostly me
Something incredible I'll do something incredible
I wanna be the Mormon who changed all of mankind
My best friend
It's something I've foreseen And now that I'm nineteen
I'll do something incredible That blows God's freaking mind!
And as long as we stick together And I stay out of your way
Out of my way
We'll change the world forever
And make tomorrow a Latter Day!
Mostly me!
So quit thinking about it and do it
How ready and psyched are we?
And life is about to change for you And life is about to change for me And life is about to change for you and me
And there's no limit to what we can do...
Me and you...
But mostly...
Well, looks like we made it, huh?
Yeah, that was... that was one long trip.
I'll say!
Here we are in Kitguli, Uganda, and what do you think of Uganda, Elder?
Well uum, I think it's really different!
Yeah yeah! What have we here, maybe?
!
German?
British?
American.
Hello sir. Uh, we're here to see Mister Mafala Hatimbi.
Yeah. Your bags!
Oh uh, sir, we don't have anything illegal in there, sir.
Uh, we're from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.
Here are some men with guns searching through our bags.
We take these bags!
What? This is your tariff... to the general!
The, the general?
Let I get one thi-
You shut the fuck up!
Omigosh! Okay- Just take the bags!
Why are you doing this?
Ahh, there you are!
I have been looking all over for you.
I am Mafala Hatimbi. I have been hired to show you to your building.
Look, some men just took our bags.
You must be very careful around here.
Now let's get going!
Uh no, uh, shouldn't you call the police and see if we can get our bags back?
Oho, the police...
The police are in Kampala, two days' drive away.
There's a lot of really important stuff in those bags.
Oh well, "Hasa Diga Eebowai."
'Scuse me?
You're in Northern Uganda now, and in this part of Africa, we all have a saying.
Whenever something bad happens, we just throw our hands to the sky and say "Hasa Diga Eebowai!"
Hasa Diga Eebowai?
It's the only way to get through all these troubled times.
There's war, poverty, famine...
But having a saying makes it all seem better!
There isn't enough food to eat Hasa Diga Eebowai
People are starving in the street Hasa Diga Eebowai
Hasa Diga Eebowai! Hasa Diga Eebowai!
Well, that's pretty neat!
Does it mean no worries for the rest of our days?
Kind of!
We've had no rain in several days (Hasa Diga Eebowai!
)
And eighty percent of us have AIDS (Hasa Diga Eebowai!
)
Many young girls here get circumcised Their clits get cut right off (Way oh!
And so we say up to the sky Hasa Diga Eebowai!
Hasa Diga Eebowai! Hasa Diga Eebowai!
Now you try!
Just stand up tall, tilt your head to the sky, and list off the bad things in your life.
Somebody took our luggage away (Hasa Diga Eebowai!
The plane was crowded and the bus was late
(Hasa Diga Eebowai!
When the world is getting you down There's nobody else to blame (Way oh!
) Raise your middle finger to the sky And curse his rotten name
Wait, what?
Hasa Diga Eebowai!
Am I saying that right?
Excuse me, sir, but what exactly does that phrase mean?
Well, let's see... "Eebowai" means "God", and "Hasa Diga" means "Fuck you!".
So I guess in English it would be, "Fuck you, God!" (Hasa Diga Eebowai!
)
What? !
When God fucks you in the butt, (Hasa Diga Eebowai!
)
Fuck God back right in his cunt (Hasa Diga Eebowai!
Hasa Diga Eebowai! What a nifty phrase!
Hasa Diga Eebowai Hasa Diga Eebowai
Hasa Diga Eebowai Hasa Diga Eebowai
You have to stop saying that!
What? Hasa Diga...
It means something very bad.
What?
They're saying F you to Heavenly Father!
F you Heavenly Father?
! Holy Moly! I said it like thirteen times!
Hasa Diga Eebowai! (Fuck you, God!
) Hasa Diga Eebowai!
(Fuck you, God!
Excuse me, sir, but you should really not be saying that.
Things aren't always as bad as they seem.
Oh, really?
Well, take this fucking asshole, Mutumbo, here.
He got caught last week trying to rape a baby.
What!
?
Why? Some people in his tribe believe that having sex with a virgin will cure their AIDS.
There aren't many virgins left, so some of them are turning to babies.
But... that's horrible!
I know!
(Hasa Diga Eebowai!
Here's the butcher, he has AIDS Here's the teacher, she has AIDS
Here's the doctor, he has AIDS – Here's my daughter she has A wonderful disposition!
She's all I have left in the world
And if either of you lays a hand on her...
If you don't like what we say Try living here a couple days
Watch all your friends and family die Hasa Diga Eebowai!
Fuck you!
Fuck you...
Hasa Diga Eebowai!
Fuck you, God, in the ass, mouth, and cunt-a
Fuck you, God, in the ass, mouth, and cunt-a
Fuck you, God, in the ass, mouth, and cunt-a
Fuck you in the eye!
Fuck you, God, in the ass, mouth, and cunt-a Fuck you, God, in the ass, mouth, and cunt-a
Fuck you in the other eye!
Hasa Diga Eebowai!
Fuck you, fuck you God Hasa Diga!
Fuck you God!
In the cunt!
Fuck you, God!
This is where my father asked me to bring you. The others like you should be inside.
Thank you very much, Jam ban Chofi.
Nabulungi.
Nam ban Chofi.
Ah, I'm sorry.
We, we really appreciate your help, Nabulungi.
Oh hey, hey...
Um, heh, um, um, look, maybe, maybe sometime Elder Cunningham and I could, could talk to you, maybe tell you a little bit about the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints?
I, I have to get back to my village, but I am always there if you would like to talk.
Just, just one piece of advice:
No matter how hot you get at night, keep your windows closed.
It is the only way to protect against the scorpions.
And the mosquitoes.
And the lions.
And the murderers and the robbers, and the AIDS, and the snakes, and the safari ants, which can actually plant their eggs underneath your skin and eat you from the inside out.
Man elder, can you believe this?
I know, she is such a hot shade of black, right?
She's like, she's like a latte.
Let's go inside and meet the other elders, alright?
Hello?
The new recruits are here!
Welcome Elder Price and Elder Cunningham.
I am Elder McKinley, current district leader for this area of the Uganda mission.
Nice to meet you. And my name is Elder Church, originally from the great city of Cheyenne, Wyoming.
Elder Michaels from Provo.
Elder Thomas, but the elders here all call me Elder Pop-Tart, 'cause I love them so much.
And over there are Elder Neeley and Elder Davis.
Whoa, that's a lot to remember.
Let's sit, let's sit.
Well, we've all been together about three months now, spreading the Word of Christ, saving the souls of the fine Ugandan people through baptism.
Well uh, how many have you baptized so far?
Uh... zero.
That's practically nothing.
Zero, yes, but there's always hope that tomorrow will be different.
Right!
Because tomorrow is a Latter Day!
Hey, are you alright, partner?
Yeah.
I'm just getting a little confused... right now, so.
Oh, confused.
Well elder, that is natural.
There are certainly a lot of things here in Uganda that can be... disturbing.
But your mission has officially started.
Which means you have to do what we have all done.
I got a feelin' That you could be feelin' A whole lot better than you feel today
You say you got a problem?
Well that's no problem
It's super-easy not to feel that way
When you start to get confused Because of thoughts in your head
Don't feel those feelings
Hold them in instead
Turn it off
Like a light switch Just go click
It's a cool little Mormon trick We do it all the time
When you're feelin' certain feelings that just don't seem right Treat those pesky feelings like a reading light
And turn them off Like a light switch
Just go bap Really, what's so hard about that?
Turn it off!
Turn it off!
Okay When I was young my dad Would treat my mom real bad
Every time the Utah Jazz would lose
He'd start a-drinkin' And I'd start a-thinkin'
"How am I gonna keep my Mom from getting abused?"
I'd see her all scared And my soul was dyin'
My dad would say to me "now don't you dare start cryin'!"
Turn it off Like a light switch Just go click
It's our nifty little Mormon trick
Turn it off!
Turn. It.
My sister was a dancer But she got cancer
The doctor said she still had two months more
I thought she had time So I got in line For the new iPhone at the Apple Store
She lay there dying with my father and mother
Her very last words were "Where is my brother?"
Turn it off!
Bid those sad feelings adieu
The fear that I might get cancer too...
When I was in fifth grade I had a friend, Steve Glade
He and I were close as two friends could be
One thing led to another, and soon I would discover
(Wow! ) I was having really strange feelings for Steve...
I thought about us On a deserted island (We're all alone...)
We'd swim naked in the sea, and then he'd try and...
Woah!
Turn it off!
Like a light switch
There it's gone!
(Good for you!
) My hetero side just won!
I'm all better now
Boys should be with girls, That's Heavenly Father's plan
So if you ever feel you'd rather be with a man
Turn it off!
Well, Elder McKinley, I think it's okay that you're having gay thoughts. Just so long as you never act upon them.
No, 'cause then you're just keepin' it down
Like a dimmer switch on low... (On low...)
Thinking nobody needs to know (Uh oh...)
But that's not true!
Being gay is bad, But lying is worse
So just realize you have a curable curse, And turn it off!
(Turn it off!
Turn it off!
Now, how do you feel?
The same.
Then you've only got yourself to blame
You didn't pretend hard enough
Imagine that your brain is made of tiny boxes Then find the box that's gay and CRUSH IT!
Okay?
No, no.
I'm not having gay thoughts.
Alright! It worked!
Yay! He turned it ooooff!
(Turned it off! ) Turn it off!
Turn it off! Turn it off! Turn it off!
Like a light switch Just go 'click'!
(Click click!
) What a cool little Mormon trick (Trick trick!
) We do it all the time!
When you're feelin' certain feelings that just don't seem right (don't seem right) Treat those pesky feelings like a reading light
And turn it off!
Like a light switch on a cord And now he isn't gay any
Turn it, turn it, turn it, turn it...
Turn it, turn it, turn it, turn it... Turn it...
Turn it off!
Alright elders, alright. Our two new missionaries must be exhausted from all their travels.
Let's show them their room so they can unpack.
A six, seven, eight.
Tada. All right!
Check it out! We get to sleep right next to each other!
Alright elders, get settled in.
Now, according to missionary rules, lights out promptly at 10, and we all wake up at exactly 6:30.
I've heard a lot of great things about you, Elder Price.
I'm really hopin' you can... turn things around here.
Hoho, don't worry. We will.
Elders, we're glad you're here.
Heavenly Father, as we prepare to turn in for the night, we ask that you give us the...
the strength to spread your wisdom and also, and also the knowledge-
Do you think Frodo was really the hero of The Lord of the Rings?
Sometimes I think it was actually Samwise that did everything.
What?
I mean think about it:
Who got the ring back from Gollum?
Hm?
OH!
Samwise.
And who pulled Frodo up the side of the mountain? Just think about however to- I remember now!
Samwise Gamgee did it!
Okay um, uh, Elder,
I - Maybe we should have some companionship evaluation time.
Oh, yeah!
Uh, you clearly... have a great passion for uh... for, for things.
And, and and you like to talk about... stuff?
Um, I was wondering if maybe uh, the things and stuff you seem to be focusing on are the things and stuff that apply to the reason we are here.
Can you do that for me?
I'd do anything for you!
I'm your best friend.
Well, all right...
Let's get some sleep, huh?
Sleep now, little buddy, Put your cares aside
Nappy with a happy face, I am by your side
What are you doing?
I'm just trying to make you feel better.
I feel fine.
But this is what I'm talking about.
Your focus needs to be on our work.
Do you understand how difficult this is gonna be?
The missionaries here have yet to baptize a single person.
Well, if they had already baptized a bunch of people here, then it wouldn't be so incredible when you did it, now would it?
I guess.
I guess that's sort of true...
Don't worry.
I'm not gonna let you down.
Today we're gonna bring lots of Africans to the church.
I just know it.
You know what, Elder?
Really?
Yeah.
Evening star shines brightly, God makes life anew!
Sleep now, tighty night!
And I am here for you.
I am here for you, too.
We are here, for us.
Goodnight, best friend!
Nabulungi!
Where have you been?
! Baba, look what I found in the market!
What have I told you about wandering off? !
The market is not safe!
But Baba, I finally found one.
A texting device.
Now I can text all of my friends.
Listen to me woman!
Do not go to the market again!
The general is mutilating girls in the next village over!
Baba I'm sorry.
Nabulungi, we must be careful.
If we want to stay alive, our village needs to lay low and not attract any attention.
City lights here we go from northern ligh...
Let's go out and get some placements!
Right!
Uh, what's a placement again?
A placement is getting somebody to take a Book of Mormon.
If you give one out, that counts as a placement.
Remember?
Right, I knew that...
Look, maybe you should just let me do the talking and you can sort of support what I'm saying by going "oh wow" and stuff like that.
Yeah!
Yeah, like one of those infomercials.
You know how they have, how they always have some guy trying to sell something and then, there's always some lady standing next to them saying "Oh wow, what an incredible offer!"
I'm, I'm like that lady!
Okay.
Yeah!
Okay, whatever.
Uh, what do you say we just start with this little house, huh?
We just walk up like we're at the missionary training center.
Okay!
- Okay!
There's no doorbell!
There isn't any doorbell!
What do you want?
!
Oh...
Hello ma'am, do you ever feel like there's something missing from your life?
Um, when you go to sleep at night, do you sometimes feel a power stirring inside you?
Yes.
That's how I feel.
You sir!
Come on down here, huh?
Do you find yourself asking questions about this feeling?
Yes.
And it's because... you want to believe in something else, isn't it?
No, it's because I have maggots in my scrotum.
You've got what?
! I have maggots in my scrotum.
Can you tell?
Well, uh, you, you should probably see the doctor.
I am the doctor.
Just calm down, calm down!
Ladies and gentlemen, we would like to tell you all about a very special book.
Eh, what kind of book?
Well, this book tells you how to find Paradise... through Christ.
They've heard of the Bible.
We all have.
Banbanchelfi.
People come and tell us about Jesus and him dying for our sins once a year.
They always come, tell us the story, and leave!
Nothing is better!
Your Bible doesn't work.
Well of course that didn't work.
Those were Christian missionaries.
We're Mormons.
What's the difference?
We've got a little more...
A touch more rock 'n' roll.
And most important, a hip new prophet by the name of Joseph Smith.
Have you heard of the All-American Prophet?
The blond-haired, blue-eyed voice of God?
He didn't come from the Middle East like those other holy men,
The most blessed Prophet was All-American!
I'm gonna take you back to Biblical times. 1823.
An American man named Joe livin' on a farm
In the holy land of upstate New York!
You mean the Mormon prophet Joseph Smith?
That's right!
That young man spoke to God!
He spoke to God?
And God said "Joe, people really need to know that the Bible isn't two parts!
There's a part three to The Bible, Joe!
And I, God, have anointed you to dig up this part three that's buried by a tree on a hill in your backyard!"
Wow!
God says go to your backyard and start digging!
That makes perfect sense!
Joseph Smith went up on that hill and dug where he was told!
And deep in the ground Joseph found shining plates of gold!
What are these golden plates?
Who buried them here and why?
Then appeared an angel:
His name was Moroni!
I... am Moroni.
The All-American angel!
My people lived here long, long ago!
This is a history of my race, please read the words within
We were Jews who met with Christ, but we were All-American!
But don't let anybody see these plates except for you...
They are only for you to see...
Even if people ask you to show the plates to them, don't
Just copy them onto normal paper
Even though this might make them question if the plates are real or not...
This is sort of what God is going for...
Joseph took the plates home and wrote down what he found inside
He turned those plates into a book, Then he rushed into town and cried:
Hey!
God spoke to me and gave me this blessed ancient tome
He has commanded me to publish it And stick it in ev'ry home!
Wow!
So the Bible is actually a trilogy and the Book of Mormon is Return of the Jedi?
I'm interested!
Now many people didn't believe the prophet Joseph Smith.
They thought he made up this part three that was buried by a tree on the hill in his backyard.
Many people even called Joseph Smith a liar.
So Joe said,
This is no lie, I speak to God all the time and he told me to head west!
So I'll take my part three from the hill with the tree
Feel free if you'd like to come along with me to the promised land!
Paradise, on the west coast!
Nothing but fruit and fields as far as the eye can see!
Joe led his followers across the USA
Spreading their new religion to folks along the way
They kept searching for that promised land, no promise there would be.
And as they passed through every town, the Mormons would decree!
Have you heard of the All-American prophet?
He found a brand-new book about Jesus Christ!
We're following him to Paradise, we call ourselves Mormon
And our new religion is All-American!
Wow, this all sounds so incredibly awesome!
The Mormons kept on searching for that place to settle down But every time they thought they found it they got kicked out of town
And even though people wanted to see the golden plates
Joseph never showed 'em!
I have maggots in my scrotum
Um... okay...
Well, anyway...
Now comes the part of our story That gets a little bit sad
On the way to the promised land, Mormons made people mad
Joseph was shot by an angry mob And knew he'd soon be dead
And even as his life drained away, he stood by what he said:
You must now lead the people, my good friend Brigham Young
You're wise and pure of heart, and... all-Ameri... can
Oh God, Why are you letting me die
Without having me show people the plates?
They'll have no proof I was telling the truth or not
They'll have to believe me just... 'cause
I guess that's kinda what you were going for...
The prophet Joseph Smith died for what he believed in.
But his followers, they kept heading west.
And Brigham Young led them to paradise.
A sparkling land in Utah they called Salt Lake City.
And we come from there today to tell you what those early settlers sang long ago!
Have you heard of the All-American Church
Here's a pocket hand-held Bible for you!
It'll all make sense if you read Part 3, so follow those books from the hill with the tree!
And you'll reach the promised land too!
Keep you word and then we'll also throw in a set of steak knives!
All-American!
So?
Who would like their very own copy of the Book of Mormon?
What the fuck is a steak knife?
What the heck were you doing?
Just doing my part, you know, 'cause we're supposed to be a team.
Well... there's nothing in the Book of Mormon about steak knives!
I'm sorry.
I've never actually read it.
You what?
It's... it's just so boring!
How could I even believe that you...?
He's here!
What is this?
Some kind of public assembly?
My name is General Koni, leader of the NRA Rebellion and protector!
Here you don't protect anyone!
We have not signed up for your rebellion!
It is just a gang of thugs who steal and mutilate women for no reason!
For no reason?
The clitoris... is an abomination!
Its voodoo power has brought a wrath upon Uganda and it must be cast out!
My wife's body is none of your business!
And you are no general.
By the end of the week, all females in this village will be circumcised!
Or else...
All right, they're all gone.
You have to stay indoors, Nabulungi!
Keep the lights off, and the windows closed!
But Baba, we have to help and fight him!
We can't fight against this, Nabulungi!
We just have to hope they move on!
- But Baba... they white boys...
- What? They said they know the answers to our problems.
I have to go check on the others!
Listen to me, Baba!
The Mormons talked about people who were miserable like us, but they all found someplace to go.
Somewhere wonderful.
I'm going to text them right now and tell them we are interested.
Put that stupid thing down!
Just stay inside, and do not open the door for anyone!
My mother once told me of a place With waterfalls and unicorns flying Where there was no suffering, no pain Where there was laughter instead of dying
I always thought she'd made it up To comfort me in times of pain
But now I know that place is real Now I know its name
Sal Tlay Ka Siti Not just a story mama told
But a village in Ootah Where the roofs are thatched with gold
If I could let myself believe I know just where I'd be
Right on the next bus to paradise:
I can imagine what it must be like This perfect, happy place
I'll bet the goat meat there is plentiful,
And they have vitamin injections by the case
The warlords there are friendly They help you cross the street
And there's a Red Cross on every corner
With all the flour you can eat!
Sal Tlay Ka Siti The most perfect place on Earth
Where flies don't bite your eyeballs And human life has worth
It isn't a place of fairy tales It's as real as it can be
A land where evil doesn't exist Sal Tlay Ka Siti
And I'll bet the weather is nice there
And I'm sure the streets are clean
And I hope that when I get there I'll be able to fit in...
Will I fit in?
Sal Tlay Ka Siti A land of hope and joy
And if I want to get there I just have to follow that white boy
You were right, mama, you didn't lie The place is real, and I'm gonna fly!
I'm on my way
Soon life won't be so... shitty
Now salvation has a name
Sal Tlay Ka Siti
O. M. Gosh you guys, I am freaking out!
What is it?
I just got off the phone with the zone leader.
The mission president wants a written progress report from us this week!
A progress report?
But we don't have any baptisms.
I know that!
What are we gonna do? !
Okay okay okay! Hold on!
I mean, maybe we should just... say... we had some baptisms.
What? You mean, lie?
Well...
Are you an idiot?
! Mormons don't lie!
I once told a lie when I was 12 and I had a dream that I went to Hell!
It was really spooky.
You did?
I got the worst hell dreams after the day that my sister died.
You guys have the hell dreams too?
Look, we've all had the Spooky Hell Dream, people.
I have it nightly.
The issue now is what the heck am I supposed to tell the Mission President!
Elder Price?
What happened to you? !
Africa... is nothing like The Lion King!
I think that movie took a lot of artistic license!
He's upset because we just saw some guy get shot in the face.
I can't continue my mission in this way!
There's absolutely nothing I can accomplish here!
Elder Price, you cannot lose your cool on me now!
We're about to get evaluated by the Mission President!
The Mission President...
That's it, I need to go talk to the Mission President and get transferred!
Buddy!
Buddy, I know things seem tough right now, but remember, tomorrow is a Latter Day!
Yeah! Latter Day doesn't mean tomorrow!
It means the afterlife!
Latter Day, when good people get to go to Heavenly Father and they get everything they've always wanted!
I'm out of here!
Hey, hey!
Are you forgetting Rule Number 23?
You may not...
leave the living quarters after 9 pm!
To heck with the rules!
I'm not wasting the most important two years of my life!
Hey uh...
Hold up, you forgot me!
Elder Cunningham!
Do you also want to break Rule Number 23?
Oh no!
What am I supposed to do?
According to Rule Number 23, I can't leave the living quarters after curfew!
But according to Rule Number 72 I can't leave my companion alone!
This is like a Matrix logic trick!
Rule 23, Rule 72, Rule 23...
I CAN'T SEE!
It's been a thing since I was a kid.
I'm sorry guys, he's my best friend!
Hey, come on! We're supposed to be together at all times!
I can't do something incredible here!
Okay!
Stop, breathe, think!
This isn't what you want to do.
Yes it is!
Okay!
Uhhh, right.
If that's what you want to do, then that's what we're doin'.
We're transferring.
I'm with you- I didn't say we're transferring!
I said I am.
Oh I see...
Look, you and me, we're s- not that compatible, alright?
Well we only became best friends a few days ago.
May- And I'm not your best friend!
I just got stuck with you by the missionary training center!
I didn't mean to...
I didn't mean to say "stuck"...
It's just that-
Eh, yeah, yeah, it's fine.
It's, it's alright.
I know how it goes.
It's really fine.
I'll be, I'll be totally fine.
Yes! Yes, you will be fine. It's just that we...
need um... different things.
- Right.
Right, just... different things is all.
It was really nice meeting you.
Yeah...
You too.
Take it easy.
Evening star shines brightly God makes life anew
Sleep now, tighty night I was there for you
There you are!
Thank goodness I found you.
Where is your friend?
Uh, I don't have any friends.
No!
I have written Elder Price a text.
Here.
It says to please come back to the village.
We are ready.
To do what?
To listen to him.
I texted everyone that we have to give Elder Price a chance.
Well I'm sorry, he's requested a transfer.
What is a transfer?
That means he'll be sent somewhere else.
No, he can't leave.
We are ready to listen.
It's too late.
He's already made up his mind.
What about you?
Me?
What?
He is gone, but you are still here.
You will lead us!
Teach us everything about what is in the Book of Mormon!
Me?
Nooo!
Noohoho!
I'm a follower.
Everyone's waiting.
Come back to the village and you will have your listeners.
I swear it.
What did Jesus do When they sentenced him to die?
Did he try to run away?
Did he just break down and cry?
No, Jesus dug down deep, knowing what he had to do
When faced with his own death, Jesus knew that he had to...
Man up He had to man up
So he crawled up on that cross, and he stuck it out
And he manned up Christ, he manned up
And taught us all what real manning up is about
And now it's up to me, and it's time to man up
Jesus had his time to, now it's mine to man up
I'm taking the reins, I'm crossing the bear
And just like Jesus, I'm growing a pair!
I've gotta stand up, can't just clam up
It's time to man up!
'Cause there's a time in your life when you know you've got to man up
Don't let it pass you by There's just one time to man up
Watch me man up like nobody else!
I'm gonna man up all over myself!
I've got to get ready It's time to, time to...
What did Jesus do when they put nails through his hands?
Did he scream like a girl, or did he take it like a man?
When someone had to die to save us from our sins,
Jesus said, "I'll do it," and he took it on the chin!
He manned up, and manned up
He took a bullet for me and you That's man up, real man up
And now it's my time to do it too!
Time to be a hero and slay the monster!
Time to battle darkness You're not my father!
I'm gonna time to, just watch me go!
Time to stand up and steal the show!
Time to, time to, time to, time to, time to...
Sal Tlay Ka Siti, a place of hope and joy
To man up!
And if we want to go there, we just have to follow that white boy
Time to!
Heavenly Father, why do you let bad things happen?
- Ka-lay-ka Siti!
- Did you get my text?
I can't believe all the terrible things you let happen!
Ka-lay-ka Siti, we got your text!
I don't belong in a place like this!
(Man up! )
Take me back to where things make sense! A place I know where God exists:
Orlando!
Orlando!
We will listen to the fat white guy!
My time to, time to Now it's my time to, time to!
But Hasa Diga Eebowai!
No time to, not time to Now it's time to, time to!
I'm in the lead for the very first time!
I'm home with the people to show me ta-
Mine to! I've got to stand up, get my flippin' can up
It's time to, time to!
Man up!
Sal Tlay Ka Siti
Sal Tlay Ka Siti Sal Tlay... It is time to...
I have maggots in my scrotum!
Indeed, it came to pass that the prophet Joseph Smith discovered the Book of Mormon on golden plates.
But what exactly is the Book of Mormon about?
It tells of two Hebrew tribes that walked in ancient America.
The gentle Nephites, and the wicked Lamanites.
They fought many great battles, but then, just after his crucifixion, Christ appeared.
I... am Jesus.
I've just been crucified on the other side of the world.
I only have three days before I am resurrected, but in that time I will preach here to you in America.
And lo, Christ spoke of many things, and the Nephites came forth and wrote the teachings on plates of gold.
Plates that became the Book of Mormon, a book that is still today read by missionaries all over the world!
And it came to pass that the Nephites did gather together a great number of men, even to exceed the number of 30,000.
Uh...
And it came to pass that, in the same year, they had a number of battles in which the Nephites did beat the Lamanites and did slay many of them.
And what the fuck does that mean?
It means, you know, you should be nice to each other, or s- or something.
The LORD was so displeased with the Lamanites that he caused a cursing to come upon them.
And wherefore as they were white and delightsome, the LORD God did cause a skin of blackness to come upon them, and God said-
Nev- mi-, never mind, let's, let's forget that part.
How is this supposed to make things better for us?
The general is going to come back, and if he sees us here, we are all dead!
Baba, please!
We just need to listen.
To what?
!
Three hours we've been listening to him talk about stupid shit that happened on the other side of the Earth thousands of years ago!
It has nothing to do with us.
Yeah! And those Nephites probably didn't even have AIDS to deal with!
! Sure they did!
Sure they did!
Back then people had even worse AIDS!
Yeah!
And lo, the LORD said unto the Nephites:
"I know you're really depressed, what with all your AIDS, and everything, but there's an answer in Christ."
You see?
This book can help us.
I just told a lie...
No wait, I didn't lie,
I just used my imagination
And it worked!
You're making things up again, Arnold
But it worked, Dad!
You're stretching the truth again and you know it
Don't be a fibbing Fran, Arnold
Joseph Smith?
Because a lie is a lie
It's not a lie!
You're making things up again, Arnold
Oh conscience!
You're taking the Holy Word and adding fiction
Be careful how you proceed, Arnold
When you fib, there's a price
Ah, this is bullshit!
The story that I have been told is that the way to cure AIDS is by sleeping with a virgin!
Ah, I'm going to go and rape a baby.
WHAT?
OH MY, NO!
YOU CAN'T DO THAT! NO!
Why not? !
Because that is definitely against God's will!
Says who?
Where in that book of yours does it say anything about sleeping with a baby? !
Nowhere!
Uh, behold!
The LORD said to the Mormon prophet Joseph Smith,
"You shall NOT have sex with that infant!"
And lo Joseph said, "Why not, LORD?
Huh? Why not?"
And the LORD said,
"if you lay with that infant, you shall... burn in the fiery pits of...
Really?
Uh huh...
Uh huh.
"A baby cannot cure your illness, Joseph Smith.
I shall give unto you a... a FROG." And thus, Joseph laid with the frog, and his AIDS was no more!
You're making things up again, Arnold
You're recklessly morphing the words of Jesus
You can't just say what you want, Arnold
Come on, Hobbits!
You're digging yourself a deep hole
I'm making things up again, kind of,
But this time it's helping a dozen people
It's nothing so bad, because this time I'm not committing a sin just by making things up again!
- Right? - No!
Elder Cunningham, you have to stop him!
What?
What is it?
Gotswana is going to cut off his daughter's clitoris.
Huh?
This is all very interesting, but the general said that it is because our women aren't circumcised that God has brought this wrath upon us!
No, doing that to a lady is definitely against Christ's will!
How do you know? !
Christ never said nothin' 'bout no clitoris!
YES!
YES HE DI-ID!
In ancient New York three men were about to cut off a Mormon woman's cli- toris.
But, right before they did, Jesus had... Boba Fett turn them into frogs!
Frogs?
You mean like the frog that got fucked by Joseph Smith?
Riiight.
Riiiight, like those frogs.
For "a clitoris is holy amongst all things," said He.
You're making things up again, Arnold (We're learning the truth)
You're taking the Holy Word and adding fiction (The truth about God!
Be careful how you proceed, Arnold (We're going to Paradise!
) When you fib, there's a price
Who would have thought I'd have this magic touch?
Who'd have believed I could man up this much?
I'm talkin', they're listenin', My stories are glistening',
I'm gonna save them all with this stuff!
You're making things up again, Arnold. (Elder Cunningham!
You're making things up again, Arnold. (Holy prophet man!
) You're making things up again, Arnold. (Our savior!
)
You're making things up again...
Hmm, up again making things you are
Arnold...
I'm here!
This is it!
I'm here!
Ah!
It's even better than I could've imagined!
The streets are clean, the people are happy...
Epcot Center.
I can see the ball!
The funny thing is, I don't really remember getting here.
Wait, this can't be Orlando.
I don't even remember the plane landing.
What's happening to me?
Elder Price!
Who is that?
! You broke the rules, Elder!
Your soul belongs to me now!
Mickey?
You now dwell in eternal flame!
I remember this place!
Long ago when I was five
I snuck in the kitchen late at night And ate a doughnut with a maple glaze
My father asked who ate the snack I said that it was my brother Jack
And Jack got grounded for fourteen days
I've lived with that guilt all of my life And the terrible vision that I had that night
No, please!
I don't wanna go back!
Down, down thy soul is cast!
From the Earth whence forth ye fell!
The path of fire leads thee To Spooky Mormon Hell Dream!
Welcome back to Spooky Mormon Hell Dream!
You are having A Spooky Mormon Hell Dream now!
And now I've gone and done it again (Rectus!
I committed another awful sin (Dominus!
) I left my mission companion all alone (Spookytus!
)
Oh God, how could I have done this to you?
(Deus! )
How could I break Rule 72? (Creepyus!
)
And now my soul hath just been thrown Back into Spooky Mormon Hell Dream!
Down, down to Satan's realm See where you belong!
There is nothing you can do
No escape from Spooky Mormon Hell Dream!
You blamed your brother for eating the doughnut, and now you walk out on your mission companion?
You're a dick!
Jesus, I'm sorry!
Jesus hates you, this we know!
For Jesus just told you so!
You remember Lucifer? !
He is even spookier!
Bring him to meeee!
Minions of Hades, have you heard the news?
Kevin was caught playing hooky!
Now he's back with all you Cath'lics and Jews!
It's super spooky-wooky!
I'm sorry, Lord, it was selfish of me To break the rules, please I don't wanna be
In this Spooky Mormon Hell Dream!
Spooky Mormon Hell Dream!
Genghis Khan, Jeffrey Dahmer, Hitler, Johnnie Cochran
Their spirits all surround you!
Spooky, spooky, spoooo-ky!
I started a war und killed millions of Jews!
I slaughtered the Chinese!
I stabbed a guy and fucked his corpse!
I got OJ free!
You think that's bad?
I broke Rule 72!
I left my companion and I'm way worse than you!
I hate this Spooky Mormon Hell Dream!
Spooky Mormon Hell Dream!
Oh, Heavenly Father!
Please give me one more chance!
I won't break the rules again!
Spooky Mormon Hell Dream Spooky Mormon Hell Dream
Dad!
I can't believe Jesus called me a dick!
Welcome, welcome to Spooky Mormon Hell Dream!
You are never waking up from Spooky Mormon Hell Dream!
Oh, please help me Father! (Down, down thy soul is cast) Please let me wake up!
Give me one more chance!
I won't let you down again! (In Spooky Mormon Hell Dream! )
Spooky Mormon Hell Dream now!
Spooky Mormon Hell Dream done!
Come on, Elder Price. Wake up, buddy.
Wait, what? ! Where am I?
It looks like you passed out at the bus station.
We were so worried!
Oh I'm, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry that I had a little, uh meltdown, last night.
But I'm not leaving.
Oh, good, good.
That I was wrong, and I'm gonna stay here and stick to my work!
Oh.
You had the Hell dream, didn't you?
Was I in it?
Oh, hey guys.
Elder Cunningham, where on Heavenly Father's green Earth have you been?
Oh, nowhere much, just with ten eager Africans who are now interested in the Church!
Yes, yep, they're completely into the teachings and ready to learn more.
Are you serious, Elder Cunningham?
That's amazing!
Oh, Elder Price.
Hey.
So, did you find yourself a new... companion?
No.
No, I didn't. And I'm sorry about that.
But this is great, Elder Cunningham.
If you've got some eager followers, we could really turn things around here!
I think we should start... preparing which verses we're going to teach them, maybe maybe prep some exercises, or find some, some music, maybe then-
WOOAAHHH!
WOH-HOOAAAHHH!
You left me!
Remember?
Yes, I know.
And I'm sorry.
But Heavenly Father has shown me I need to stay here!
So now what?
I'm just supposed to take you back?
Elder Cunningham.
We must all work in pairs. Remember?
Give Elder Cunningham a break!
If it's working better this way, then, leave Elder Price out of it.
Now, how many of the people want to have follow-up sessions?
Oh um, let's see, all of them!
Do you think we might actually get a baptism out of this?
They always say you just have to get that first baptism and the others will follow!
Hold up!
I know I'm doing a really good job and all, but let's not get too carried away, I mean, a lot of the people here are so scared to death of that General Koni guy.
It's true.
Everywhere we go, people keep talking about General Koni, and how he'll kill them.
Sometime I'd like to convince that general that what he's doing is wrong.
Well no one is going to change how a warlord thinks.
That would take something...
Something incredible Something incredible
Look, let's just be happy that Elder Cunningham has the people interested.
It's okay you guys!
I've got everything under control!
I know what Heavenly Father wants for me now.
This whole country is gonna be SAVED!
Ever since I was a child I tried to be the best
So what happened?
My family and friends all said I was blessed
So what happened?
It was supposed to be all so exciting
To be teaching of Christ 'cross the sea
But I allowed my faith to be shaken Oh, what's the matter with me?
I've always longed to help the needy
To do the things I never dared
This was the time for me to step up So then why was I so scared?
A warlord who shoots people in the face
What's so scary about that?
I must trust that my Lord is mightier
And always has my back
Now I must be completely devout
I can't have even one shred of doubt!
I believe that the Lord God created the universe
I believe that he sent his only son to die for my sins
And I believe that ancient Jews built boats and sailed to America
I am a Mormon And a Mormon just believes
You cannot just believe partway You have to believe in it all
My problem was doubting the Lord's work, instead of standing tall
I can't allow myself to have any doubt
It's time to set my worries free
Time to show the world what Elder Price is about
And while I show them, I'll show me!
I believe that God has a plan for all of us
I believe that plan involves me getting my own planet
And I believe that the current President of the Church, Thomas Monson, speaks directly to God!
I am a Mormon, and dang it, A Mormon just believes!
I know that I must go And do the things my God commands
I realize now why he sent me here!
If you ask the Lord in faith He will always answer you
Just believe in him and have no fear
General!
We have an intruder!
He just walked right into camp!
I believe that Satan has a hold of you
I believe that the Lord God has sent me here!
And I believe that in 1978 God changed his mind about black people!
You can be a Mormon A Mormon who just believes
What the fuck is this?
! And now I can feel the excitement
This is the moment I was born to do
And I feel so incredible To be sharing my faith with you
The Scriptures say that if you ask in faith If you ask God himself, you'll know
But you must ask him without any doubt
And let your spirit grow!
I believe that God lives on a planet called Kolob
I believe that Jesus has his own planet as well
And I believe that the Garden of Eden was in Jackson County, Missouri
If you believe, the Lord will reveal it And you'll know it's all true You'll just feel it
You'll be a Mormon!
And, by gosh, a Mormon just believes!
Oh, I believe!
So,
Jumamosi!
Wait!
God has spoken to me, sir!
By the power of God Almighty touch me NOT!
Uh, the power of Christ compels you!
Wait, what are you doing?
Let me go!
Right, right.
So Christ said, "You've gotta be strong, you know?
Just because the Lamanites have big Death Star weapons and stuff, doesn't mean you should let them run your lives, you know?
There's more of you than there are of them; you've gotta stand up for yourselves!" Christ said.
Oh!
Just like the way the Hobbits all stood up against Brigham Young's killers!
Very good, Middala.
So, the Nephites...
fought off the wicked Lamanites, and for punishment the Lord God turned the Lamanites... yellow!
Oh!
Like the Chinese!
Right, right.
Oh-kay we should probably stop there for today.
Hopeful we'll see everyone again tomorrow?
The book is right: we must not fight amongst each other.
I love all these Mormon stories!
They are so fucking weird and interesting!
Elder Cunningham, I just wanted to say, we are very happy Heavenly Father brought you here.
Oh, thank you.
I have never seen the people here so happy.
Even Baba.
You... are amazing.
Oh. Well, I haven't really done that much.
But you have.
I texted my friend the story of Joseph Smith's battle with diarrhea, and he said everyone in his village has read it.
You are a great man.
Thank you.
I kind of am, huh?
All the Mormons are such amazing people.
They traveled across the United States to find Paradise in Sal Tlay Ka Siti.
And even though they found it, they still travel the world to show others the way.
I guess I never really thought of it like that.
Do you think that we are worthy enough to join you?
We have been trying very hard. And we are ready to do whatever tasks you require of us.
Oh, no, no, no, no, you don't understand. There's nothing they have to do to become Mormon.
We let anybody who wants to join up, so long as they're willing to commit to the Church.
Well then, would you like to baptize me?
Shh yeah, sure, that would be... great.
Okay!
Let's do it!
What? Now?
Why not?
Well... to be honest, I've never done it before.
That's okay.
Neither have I!
Do you know how to baptize someone into the Church?
Sssure, that's something we studied over and over again at...
Mission Control Center.
Please, Elder Cunningham, I want to be baptized.
I swear to dedicate my life to the Church.
Hah, okay, I, uh, just need a second to get ready.
Okay!
I'll go get ready too.
I'm about to do it for the first time
And I'm gonna do it with a girl!
A special girl Who makes my heart kinda flutter Makes my eyes kinda blur
I can't believe I'm about to baptize her
He will baptize me He will hold me in his arms
And he will baptize me Right in front of everyone
And it will set me free When he looks into my eyes And he sees just how much I love being baptized
I'm gonna baptize her Bathe her in God's glory
And I will baptize her With everything I got
And I'll make her beg for more As I wash her free of sin
And it'll be so good She'll want me to baptize her again
Excuse me, I, I need another minute!
Never known a boy so gentle One like him is hard to find A special kind
He makes my heart kind of flutter Like a moth in a cocoon
I hope he gets to baptizing me soon!
I'm gonna baptize you!
I'm through with all my stallin'
You're gonna baptize me!
I'm ready to let you do it
And it will set us free It's time to be immersed
And I'm so happy you're about to be my first!
Are you ready?
I am ready.
So how do we do it?
Well, I hold you like this.
Yeah?
Then I lower you down.
Yeah?
And then I...
I just baptized her!
She got dowsed by Heavenly Father
I just baptized her good!
I performed like a champ!
I'm wet with salvation!
We just went all the way!
Praise be to God!
I'll never forget this day
I baptized you!
I gotcha good
You wanted it more, baby!
I'll text you later.
"Dear Mission President, it is my honor to inform you that the elders of Uganda District 9 have brought twenty new members into the Church.
They are all fully commited to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, and our numbers continue to grow."
This is outstanding.
These boys have converted more Africans than any district in the country.
Elders of District 9, you have truly honored the Church by your success.
Congratulations on becoming one...

Africans are African But we are Africa!
Hit me!
Gimme another one!
Come ON!
Thank you.
You wanna hear something funny?
I used to think drinking coffee was wrong.
You wanna know why?
Because apparently, a tribe of ancient Jews lived in America, created huge civilizations and were visited by Christ, but then, then disappeared, leaving no archaeological trace of themselves except... for golden plates, which were then dug up by a farmer who wrote down,
amongst other things, that hot drinks were not for the body to belly, so I can't have a cup of coffee!
Elder Price?
Are you okay?
Well well!
If it isn't the super Mormon!
Really changed in Uganda, aren'tcha?
I'm doin' what I can.
Yeah?
Spreadin' the Word? Makin' more brainwashed zombies?
Elder Price? What happened to you?
I woke up.
That's what happened.
Of course you woke up! You drank twelve cups of coffee!
You tell me how it is, huh?
How is it you converted all those people into Mormons? !
I don't know.
Once I baptized Nagasaki the others just fell into place.
You baptized that girl?
Yeah, I did.
Don't hate on me, elder!
You get everything you pray for!
You're doing everything I was supposed to do! Doesn't that seem a little telling to you? !
Well of what?
That the universe doesn't work the way we were told!
When I was nine years old, my family took a trip.
And it was the most... wonderful, most magical place I'd ever seen.
And I decided right then and there,
"This... is where I want to spend eternity."
My parents said that if I made God proud and I did everything the Church asked, in the latter days, I could have whatever
So I worked.
And I worked.
And even when I studied Mormon stories and I thought,
"That doesn't really make sense," I kept working!
Because I was told that one day I would get my reward!
PLANET ORLANDO!
But what do I have now?
Um...
Yeah...
Okay, anyway, so, the uh, the mission president is coming tomorrow and, I'm without my companion and, well, it just looks kind of bad-
Aaaa-oh, so thaaat's why you came!
Noo, I came because I care about you-
BULL POOP!
That is bull poop, elder!
And you know it!
Look, I know we may not be the best "companions,"
but if we can please just ACT like we're still together, in front of the mission president, it would be the best thing for the both of us.
Fine!
But don't talk to me!
And don't touch me!
- Fine!
- Fine!
Orlando Orlando
I liked you, Orlando
Your bright lights Your big dreams
Your promises you couldn't keep
Orlando Orlando
Without you, Orlando
I'm just a guy who will die And never go back... to... you...
You have all done the most amazing work on your missions.
You are the gleaming examples of Latter-Day Saints.
Praise Christ.
Praise Christ.
And you two, Elder Price and Elder Cunningham, you are the most successful missionaries in all of Africa.
Ohh, thank you sir.
My companion has been so very helpful and there for me.
Praise Christ.
Excuse me!
Excuse me mister Mormon President?
My people wish to give you a special welcome.
Neutrogena, what are you doing here?
We, we have learned so much from Elder Cunningham, and as our gift to you we wish to present the story of Joseph Smith and the first Mormons.
NOOOOOOOO!
NOOOOOOOOOOOO!
I think this is a very bad idea. Let's not do this.
No no no, elder, this is just the sort of thing the Mormon leaders need to be seeing.
Yes, yes yes, let's see what these noble Africans have learned.
And now we wish to honor you with the story of Joseph Smith, the American Moses.
Well, this is very good;
Mormon
I'm going to take you back in time, (Mormon) to the United States, 1823.
(Mormon)
A small and odd village called Upstate New York.
(Upstate)
There was disease and famine, (so sick) but also in this village lived a simple farmer who would change everything.
His name... was Joseph Smith.
Joseph Smith, American Moses
Praise be to Joseph, American prophet man
Aye my name is Joseph Smith, and I am going to fuck this baby.
What! ?
No no Joseph, don't fuck the baby Joseph Smith, don't fuck the baby
Then God came down from heaven and appeared before Joseph Smith.
Joseph Smith, do not fuck a baby
I will get rid of your AIDS If you fuck this frog
Joseph Smith fucked the frog God gave him, and his AIDS went away!
Then a great wizard named Moroni came down from the Starship Enterprise.
Joseph Smith, your village is shit.
You shall lead the villagers to a new village.
Here are the fucking directions.
And on the plates were written the directions to a new land.
Sal Tlay Ka Siti (Sal Tlay Ka Siti)
Joseph tried to convince all the villagers to follow him and his golden plates.
Liberation, equality, no more slavery for Upstate Mormon people!
I got de golden plates (gold plates)
I'm gonna lead the people (we head West)
We gotta stick together (Mormons)
We gotta help each other (we're Mormons)
And so we climb the mountain (we head West)
And we cross the river (we head West)
And we fight the oppression (Mormons)
By being nice to everyone (we are Mormons)
Not so fast Mormons, you shall not pass my mountain!
Down from the mountain look who comes: the American warlord Brigham Young!
Yeees.
I am Brigham Young.
I cut off my daughter's clitoris;
that made God angry, so he turned my nose into a clit for punishment.
Brigham Young, his nose was a clitoris
What will you do Joseph, will you fight the clitoris man?
Not fight him, help him.
Joseph Smith took his magical fuck frog and rubbed it upon Brigham Young's clit face.
And behold Brigham was cured!
Joseph Smith, magical AIDS frog
Brigham Young, frog on his clit face
Brigham Young was so grateful, he decided to join the Mormons on their journey.
Compassion, courtesy, unrelenting politeness from Upstate Mormon People!
I got de golden plates (gold plates)
I'm gonna lead the people (we head West)
We gotta stick together (Mormons)
Now comes the part of our story that gets a little bit sad.
After traveling for so long, the Mormons ran out of fresh water, and become sick... with dysentery.
Mormon go to the water, water go to the cup
Cup go to the stomach, shit come out the butt
Shit go in the water, water go in the cup
Shit go down the stomach, shit come out the butt
Ugh, oh fuck!
Oh no, the prophet Joseph Smith is now getting sick!
Shit go in the water, water go in the cup
Cup go to the thirsty, shit go to the stomach
Blood come out the butt, blood go in the water
Water go in the cup, cup go to the tongue
Shit blood in the stomach, shit blood in the mouth
Shit blood on the insides, water come out the butt
Brigham Young, you take the golden plates and lead the Mormons to the Promised Laaaand!
Desperation, mortality, perseverance!
I...
I'm got to lead the people (we head West)
We gotta stick together...
Even though their prophet had died, the Mormons stuck together and helped each other, and were really nice to everyone they came across.
And then, finally, one day the Mormons found
Sal Tlay Ka Siti.
(Sal Tlay Ka Siti)
And there, the Mormons danced with Ewoks and Jesus.
Welcome Mormons!
Now, let's all have as many babies as we can and make big Mormon families!
Fuck your woman, fuck your man, this is all part of God's plan
Mormons fuck all that they can We're in Salt Lake City land
Thank you, thank you, God
Now we are fucking
Thank you, thank you, God
God wants us fucking
Thank you, thank you, God
Get back to fucking
Thank you, thank you, God
Joseph Smith, fuck frog Brigham Young, clit face
Shit come out the butt
Jesus says:
fuck, fuck Mormons!
Elders!
I'd like to have a word with you...
I think they liked it.
We are sorry, Mission President, we had no idea...
You keep your mouth shut!
You're in enough trouble as it is!
S-sir, um, I was... just trying to help the villagers here.
See, they all really wanted to learn.
Elder! Elder, I wanted to give you this.
It's the entire play written in text.
What is going on?
What's going on here is that you have all brought ridicule down onto the Latter-Day Saints.
But we are all Latter-Day Saints now, right?
You and your people are about as far from being Latter-Day Saints as it gets.
YOU ALL!
Elder Cunningham, tell them!
We are ready to go to Sal Tlay Ka Siti.
My things are packed.
I'm so sorry, Nabagamba, but um,
I never meant that you were actually going to Salt Lake City.
But you said that we could find paradise by listening to you.
Well... when we say that, we mean paradise within yourself.
You know, it's sort of like a... like a Jesus thing.
Oh...
I see.
So, when you baptized me, it meant nothing. No, no!
It meant everything!
Uncircumcised women are going to have their families killed!
Where am I supposed to go? !
I don't, um...
I know what you people are now.
You traveled from your sparkling lovely paradise in Ootah to tell ridiculous stories to people less fortunate to make fun of them!
No no, it isn't like that...
You have crushed my soul!
I hope you all had a good laugh.
Elders, you may as well pack all your things.
This district is shut down.
Go home to your parents, and explain to them that you have all...
I really did it this time, huh?
I mean I've, I've always been a screw-up, but this?
The thing is I, I really liked her too, you know?
And in fact, maybe it was like I could almost be a normal person, with a girl who cared about me, who was... hot.
And instead I made those poor Africans put on the biggest abomination in Mormon history.
Joseph Smith dying of dysentery?
Moroni from the Starship Enterprise?
That play was the most... beautiful thing I've ever seen.
Huh?
It's like...
like you were getting a point across using modern things.
And then you tried to...
wait a minute.
You've been trying to teach me something all along, haven't you?
What?
Here I thought I could just fly in here all on my own a-a-and change everything by just sticking to Scripture.
While you were trying to show me that, that Scripture isn't that important!
I was losing my faith, and you went out and did... something incredible!
You did something incredible
For a people who had nowhere else to go
I thought they were unreachable but then they were happy, and hopeful,
and wearing costumes.
It was almost like...
Orlando...
I'm sorry that it took me so long to... realize what you were trying to teach me, Elder.
Oh, no that's, that's okay.
But what about Nathan Lane? !
I mean, I made her believe in a bunch of made-up crap!
No, no, no, it doesn't matter if the stories are true or not!
It doesn't matter now 'cause she's gonna get clit cut off and it's all my fault!
Elder, come on!
There is always hope!
I will help you fix this!
You... would do that for me?
I'd do anything for you.
You're my best friend.
We all need a partner You're the best for me
We both need each other
We're a really awesome team
As long as we're together There's nothing we cannot do
We can make things right again, me and you
But mostly me
So, what did the Mormon President think of our play?
Did Elder Cunningham like it?
He knows we are still in previews, right?
Well, well.
There you are.
There have been rumors that the people of this village are uniting to oppose us.
We have been shown another way.
No.
No, we do not oppose you.
We will do whatever you say.
Nabulungi, what is wrong?
Our prophet has told us to stick together, to fight oppression!
Forget about Elder Cunningham!
You aren't going to see him ever again!
What are you talking about?
Why aren't we?
Because Elder Cunningham... he... he... he was eaten by lions, alright?
ENOUGH!
There is only one law to obey here and that is mine!
We believe in something else!
No, stop it!
All of you!
I told you our prophet is gone.
There is no promised land, and there is no salvation. Oh no!
You cannot talk like that, Nabulungi.
Remember the first teachings of the Mormons:
When Joseph Smith died, they did not give up on their hope.
But it isn't true.
We aren't going to Sal Tlay Ka Siti.
Nabulungi!
Sal Tlay Ka Siti isn't an actual place.
It's an idea.
A metaphor.
All the stories the prophet has told us... are just metaphors.
Yeah.
You don't think a man actually fucked a frog, do you?
That's fucking stupid.
And you all believe this?
Yes.
Hello?
He has risen!
It is a miracle!
Our prophet returns, even from the dead!
There! You see?
!
He must have fucked a frog!
Who has risen from the dead?
He has! He has!
So, so you might as well just, just put down your guns!
Because they will not work against his... voodoo power!
And if you don't get out of this village, right now, he is going to command the angel Moroni, from the Death Star, to unleash the Kraken, which will then... which will then... which will then...
launch Joseph Smith's torpedoes from its mouth of Christ and turn you into a lesbian!
Oh Nala, I am so sorry!
Please, if you just give me a chance? Elder!
Elder, you don't have to say anything.
I understand.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, elders, where do you think you're going?
What do you mean "where are you going"?
We've been shut down.
Yeah, we have to go home.
Who says we have to?
What?
Guys, we wanted to go on a mission so we could spend two years of our life living someplace exciting and helping people, right?
Yeah.
Well, so let's do it!
But the mission president said we're all about as far from Latter-Day Saints as it gets.
Naw, you know what guys?
Fuck. Him.
We are still Latter-Day Saints!
All of us!
Even if we, we change some things, or we break the rules, or we have complete doubt that God exists.
It doesn't change who we are.
Latter-Day doesn't mean afterlife.
It means tomorrow.
I am a Latter-Day Saint I know not what the future holds
There are sure to be times of joy and sorrow
Who cares what happens when we're dead?
We shouldn't think that far ahead
The only Latter Day that matters is tomorrow
Screw the Church! Why don't we stay?
Tomorrow is a Latter Day Tomorrow is a Latter Day!
The skies are clearing And now the sun's coming out
It's a Latter Day tomorrow
Tomorrow is a Latter Day Tomorrow is a Latter Day
We're here for each other every step of the way
And make a Latter Day tomorrow
Americans already found a cure for AIDS But they're saving it for a Latter Day
Tomorrow is a Latter Day
I believe (Tomorrow is a Latter Day)
The skies are clearing and now the sun's coming out
It's a Latter Day tomorrow
'Cause tomorrow is a Latter Day
Tomorrow is a Latter Day Tomorrow is a Latter Day
So what will tomorrow bring?
What does the future hold?
I can almost see it now...

The book of Arnold (Arnold...)
Hello!
For thousands of years, we've wondered if we're alone in the cosmos.
Life - is it a one time event... ..or is it something that's occurred lots of times throughout the universe?
And, at this very moment, new discoveries are bringing us closer to the answers.
We are right on the cusp of being able to say life exists somewhere else.
All of our searching is leading to one ultimate goal.. finding intelligent life somewhere in the vastness of the universe.
If we could discover an advanced civilisation, it would be clearly the greatest discovery of humanity, beating out fire.
Get ready, because the known universe is about to take you on a hunt for life out there.
Over the next hour, we'll show you how the hunt for alien life has dramatically changed over the past few decades.
The lessons we're learning at the bottom of our oceans and in Yellowstone's acid pits are giving us dramatic insight into how life came to be on our planet.
And it's helping us understand and imagine how life might emerge on an alien world.
We'll take you on a journey to faraway planets, where amazing creatures may roam the lands.
Creatures that make the wildest science fiction movies look like reality shows.
And, finally, we'll show you how new technologies are being used to search for, and possibly communicate with, advanced alien civilisations.
so is Earth the only planet where life has emerged in this vast cosmos?
Are we alone?
Or are we part of something bigger- a web of life that stretches light years through the universe?
Are we alone?
And it ties into all the big questions:
How did we get here?
Where are we going?
Are we a part of a bigger picture?
But for many years the question was taboo to science.
Before the mid-1 990s, it was considered somewhat embarrassing to even address the question,
because looking for alien life seems a little frighteningly close to science fiction.
For decades, the furthest we got in looking for aliens was imagining them on the silver screen.
MAN: What is your name?
After all, alien life needs a home.
And we hadn't even found a planet outside our own solar system.
scientists, in fact, never talked about planets around other stars.
There was no way to detect them and so it was one of those domains of science that you couldn't answer, and, therefore, you didn't talk about it.
In 1 995, astronomers discovered a planet orbiting a star 50 light years from Earth.
And since then, they've found hundreds more.
For the first time in human history, we realised that our sun, with its eight major planets that go around it, is just one type of a planetary system, one example of billions.
These discoveries are exciting, but don't expect to be contacting extraterrestrial life on these planets any time soon.
While it's been a spectacular ride in the last decade to find these planets, most of them are giant planets.
Most of the worlds we've found are gas giants, which probably couldn't support life.
You can't stand on them.
There's no hard surface.
They're large balls of hydrogen and helium gas, like Jupiter and saturn.
We found a few rocky planets with hard surfaces, but they're many times more massive than Earth and contain the most hostile environments you could ever imagine.
One such planet, Corot 7B, orbits so close to its star that surface temperatures reach as high as 1,600 degrees Celsius.
sunrise here does not bring the sound of birdsong.
Instead, it's an armageddon of volcanic explosions.
Those planets are all going to be so hot, you can't develop something as complex as life.
scientists have gone back to the drawing board looking to find worlds capable of supporting life, small rocky planets like Earth.
We don't know that life has to evolve on the surface of small, rocky planets.
But we know it did once, here on Earth.
And so, it's a reasonable place to start the search.
Earth is important because we know that this little planet had everything needed to create life.
And if a distant world has similar conditions, there's at least a possibility life could emerge there, too.
If you were to give a biologist a piece of paper and say, "Write down on every line something you need for life."
They'll say you need an energy source, you need oxygen, you need water, you need carbon, you need organic compounds, you need amino acids, you need all this stuff.
There's a long list of factors that make our Earth special and perfectly suited for life.
But the most important is its distance from our energy source - the sun.
At 1 49 million kilometres away, the Earth is at just the right place for water to exist as a liquid.
so why is liquid water important?
Imagine a world so much hotter than the Earth that there are no oceans, no liquid water at all on its surface.
such a place would be like a desert.
Without water, there's nothing to let the grains of sand interact.
And in the same way, without water, there's nothing to allow the atoms - the carbon and oxygen and trace elements - to form the molecules that would give rise to the chemistry of life.
On the other hand, on a world much colder than the Earth, water can only exist as ice, and we have another problem.
This frozen block of sand has all of the grains of sand locked together.
They can't move around and interact, just the same way that on a frozen world, the atoms and molecules can't move around and interact to form the chemistry necessary for life.
But if temperatures and conditions are just right, like here on Earth, you get liquid water.
The water allows the sand grains to flow together and intermingle and form more complex structures.
In the same way, water acts like a cocktail mixer, allowing the atoms and molecules to come together and ultimately form the building blocks of life.
All that water was perfect for breeding life.
Lots of it.
It's estimated that since the emergence of Earth's first life form, 1 00 billion species have existed on the planet.
Millions are alive right now, and that fact alone tells scientists a lot as they comb the cosmos for alien life.
If we look for life in the universe we have to understand it will come in different shapes and sizes.
And the same thing occurs here on Earth.
Take this handful of dirt.
It's not just dirt, there's a lot going on in here.
There's an earthworm.
Go in a little more... ..and there are these tiny little mites.
Zoom in further... ..and there are these little creatures called protozoa.
And smaller still... ..there's bacteria, billions of them.
so you see, there really are a lot of living things in a handful of dirt and we should probably remember that if we ever go digging around on alien worlds.
Life isn't always something you can see with the naked eye.
In these piles of dirt lie the secrets to our origins.
And scientists are keeping that in perspective when they search for life in the cosmos.
You have to be looking for that bacterium first, because that's gonna be far more common.
If we don't find that, the chance of finding these tall, elegant, grey, ET guys is gonna be highly diminished.
so are there other Earths out there capable of supporting extraterrestrial life, or even bacteria?
We're closer than ever to finding the answers, because scientists have picked up the scent in this cosmic hunt.
In the hunt for alien life, scientists are focusing their efforts on finding small, rocky planets like Earth.
But searching for another Earth is like trying to find a needle in a million haystacks.
Because, from trillions of kilometres away, these small planets get lost in the blinding glare of their star's brightness.
The sad truth of the matter is that Earth-like planets are mere cosmic specks of dust, and, therefore, detecting them is really quite hard.
Hard, but not impossible.
Every now and again, the planet passes directly between us and the star.
And if it does that, it's like a little eclipse and the starlight drops.
It gets darker because the planet is blocking the light from that star.
And it turns out we can see that.
With this in mind, scientists built one of the world's most sensitive telescopes and launched it into space.
The mission, called Kepler, may not help us find extra terrestrial life but it could help us find its home.
Kepler will simply do one thing unbelievably well - measure the brightnesses of 1 00,000 stars over and over and over, looking for a few of those 1 00,000 stars that dim.
seeing the tiniest dim from a small planet travelling in front of a star thousands of light years away isn't easy to imagine, but the Kepler telescope is one of the most sensitive cameras ever built.
To give you an idea just how sensitive Kepler is, I'm gonna demonstrate using this massive World War ll searchlight.
The brightness of that searchlight represents the extreme luminosity of stars and I'm gonna use this tiny marble to represent the planet.
When this planet passes in front of the star, it blocks out a tiny fraction of the light, dimming the star by a very small amount.
And that's exactly what the Kepler spacecraft can detect.
Kepler can detect a .01 per cent change in a star's luminosity.
But even if it spots a dimming star, there's still another problem.
When Kepler sees a star that dims, it could be due to a speck of dust that crossed in front of the telescope.
There's a possibility of binary stars - two stars that orbit each other, thereby dimming the stars as one blocks the other.
To make sure Kepler's truly found a planet, scientists are using one of the largest Earth-based telescopes for confirmation.
This telescope will also determine the planet's mass and distance from its star.
scientists are most interested in the small, rocky worlds that sit in what's called the Goldilocks Zone.
Remember how important liquid water is to life?
If a planet is in the Goldilocks Zone, it's not too close and not too far from its star.
It'sjust right.
And it's possible for water to flow there as a liquid.
We obviously sit in the Goldilocks Zone, but in our solar system, Mars and Venus also do, but we've yet to find life on either of those two planets.
Knowing if a planet is inhabitable is not as straightforward as saying,
"Oh, we found a planet the size of the Earth and it's 90 million miles from a sun-like star."
Venus is uninhabitable and Mars is uninhabitable.
Why is Venus such a harsh, hideous environment, some 600 degrees Celsius or so?
And, of course, the answer for Venus, sadly, is that some greenhouse effect, global warming, has overtaken Venus.
When it formed over four billion years ago,
Venus had water, and probably vast oceans on its surface.
But there was also a lot of the greenhouse gas water vapour in the atmosphere, which blanketed and heated the planet.
And as Venus got hotter, more and more water from its surface evaporated into the atmosphere, trapping the heat even more.
On Earth, much of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide is chemically bound to the rocks.
And it was this way on young Venus, too.
But when it got to about 400 degrees Celsius, this carbon dioxide started baking out of the rocks and into the atmosphere.
With an atmosphere of water vapour and carbon dioxide, this cycle kept going and going and the runaway greenhouse effect has left Venus dry, lifeless, and a scorching 480 degrees Celsius.
Even if it weren't that hot, the atmospheric pressure at the surface is 90 times the Earth's atmospheric pressure, so you'd be crushed.
And it has sulphuric acid rain.
You know, Venus is basically, by every definition, Hell.
And yet, if you were to detect Venus orbiting another star, you might suspect it would have Earth-like conditions.
Mars also lies in the Goldilocks Zone, but it has the opposite problem of Venus.
It doesn't have enough greenhouse gases to trap in heat and it's become a cold, barren, desert world.
We have two examples of how planets have gone astray and we have to wonder how many other ways are there that a planet can fail to be habitable.
With so many ways a habitable planet can be rendered uninhabitable,
Kepler's findings are crucial, because the more potential homes it finds, the better the chance life might exist outside our little Earth.
In five years, we will know for certain, from Kepler's results, how frequent Earth-like planets are.
It will do this by only looking at 1 00,000 stars out of at least 200 billion in our galaxy.
But how is it possible to calculate the number of Earth-like planets orbiting other stars without looking at all the stars?
It's like asking how many blades of grass are there on this soccer field.
I could either get down on my hands and knees here and spend the rest of my life counting every single one or I could do what Kepler's going to do, which we call sampling.
We have a little grid - two inches by two inches on each side.
All I have to do now is count the number of blades of grass in that little two-inch square and then multiply by the number of squares that would cover this whole field.
One, two, three... 24, 25, 26, 27... 33, 34, 35... 47...
I wonder if I counted that one.
207.
207 blades of grass in a two inch by two inch patch.
Now, let's get out the calculator here and see what that means.
207 divided by two inches by two inches means 52 blades of grass per square inch.
Now we need the number of square inches in this field.
It's 1 80 by 360.
Wow, that's almost 1 0 million square inches in this field.
so, multiply that by 52 - half a billion blades of grass and I only had to count 207.
If Kepler does find Earth-like planets, this method of sampling will bring us one step closer to understanding how many habitable homes are in our galaxy.
Even if one out of a thousand stars in the Milky Way galaxy has a planet like the Earth that means there are millions and millions of Earths orbiting other stars.
so if you ask me:
is there life out there?
it seems awfully likely.
In the grand scope of the cosmos, we've considered ourselves pretty lucky to be at just the right spot and to have all the right ingredients for life to emerge.
But is it really luck?
Or does life find a way?
There are new discoveries showing us there might just be another recipe for life to emerge.
We have a general idea of what conditions are crucial for life to thrive on a planet.
We know liquid water plays a role, and we know life needs an energy source.
For us, that's our sun.
And for a long time, scientists believed that every single life form on Earth got their energy from our star.
That was until an underwater explorer, who discovered the Titanic, also helped discover something else deep in the ocean.
By far, the most important discovery I've ever made was not the Titanic.
It was when we discovered this whole new life system on our planet.
We thought all life needed access to sunlight, but working with the Wood's Hole Oceanographic Institute,
Bob Ballard found a thriving ecosystem where there was no sunlight.
There were creatures we'd never seen before.
One of the dominant organisms was what we call a tube worm and these were 6, 8 feet tall, and they had human-like blood.
And when they wanted to respirate, they would stick out the tube, basically their lung.
Prior to that discovery, we thought that all life on the Earth owed its existence to the sun.
Without sunlight, there was something else giving this life energy.
It was coming from deep inside the Earth's core.
something called black smokers, or hydrothermal vents, were bringing up minerals from deep underground.
And this was an amazing discovery because the temperature coming out of the bottom of the ocean was 650 degrees Fahrenheit.
Hot enough to melt lead.
Amazingly, this life thrived in an extremely hostile environment, which meant we needed to expand our narrow view of where life might be found.
We have to understand that life will evolve under conditions which seem horribly hostile, horribly alien.
And yet, it not only evolves and works, it thrives and has a whole ecosystem that depends on these bizarre environments.
And the bizarre environments didn't stop at the bottom of the ocean.
Life is found in the worst environments you could imagine.
Like the boiling hot springs of Yellowstone national park.
The hot springs at Yellowstone can be PH1 , just like battery acid... ..and 1 94 degrees.
If you went into this, it would dissolve you.
Dr Mark Young is an astrobiologist looking very closely at Yellowstone's hot springs.
He thinks these acid pits may be one of our biggest clues to understanding how life emerged on Earth.
Three billion years ago, planet Earth was much more like what we see in Yellowstone - boiling acid, very high temperatures, where life was dependent not so much on photosynthesis, but on the chemicals that are found
and the gases that come out of the boiling hot springs like Yellowstone.
Those pits in Yellowstone are just nasty.
In fact, the acid in them can dissolve just about anything.
I have some acid here that's a little more concentrated than you'll find in Yellowstone, but the results will be the same.
Now watch what happens to this penny when I drop it in the acid.
I'm gonna put this bell jar over to control the environment.
The green colour is copper coming from the penny and a noxious fume is being emitted.
And that's an oxide of nitrogen that is very hazardous, and I'm glad I have it in a bell jar.
What amazes me is that scientists are finding life aplenty in environments similar to that, and that just goes to show that life can flourish in even the harshest conditions.
We're finding micro-organisms not only living in these hot springs but flourishing.
Wherever there's liquid water - no matter the amount of light, the temperature, the acidity - life thrives.
This revolutionary discovery is opening us up to the possibility that life may exist in places we never thought possible.
Even under the surfaces of planets or nearby moons.
What's incredible is that it turns out that even in our own little solar system, there are diversity places where there could be life.
In 2008, a probe visited to the Martian surface, the Phoenix Mars Lander, and it made an amazing discovery.
Phoenix dug down into the dirt, and after only a couple of inches, uncovered crystals of frozen water.
The key question is; how far down does the water persist beneath the surface and if you go far enough, is the pressure and temperature high enough that the water would be liquid, not in the form of ice?
And there's a very good suggestion, I think, that there are, in fact, liquid aquifers.
We might be able to drill down and find the evidence, if any, of life on Mars at this moment.
And scientists are also excited about what they believe to be an ocean underneath the surface of Jupiter's frozen moon, Europa.
sure, it's cold and solid in the form of ice on the surface, but almost certainly, beneath the ice on Europa is a vast ocean, hundreds, if not thousands, of kilometres thick.
Europa sits well outside the Goldilocks Zone, but just like at the bottom of Earth's oceans, hydrothermal vents could be the energy source needed for life to emerge.
Those ocean depths could be home to some bizarre life forms - huge tubeworms feeding on the minerals coming from inside Europa's core.
There's no telling what kind of life may exist in Europa's ocean.
But one of the most fascinating places in our solar system is saturn's largest moon, Titan.
Titan's atmosphere and surface features are similar to Earth's 3.5 billion years ago.
Titan is one of the larger moons in the solar system and the only one to have a substantial atmosphere.
And the atmosphere has lots of methane in it.
And it's cold enough that the methane precipitates and drops, like raindrops, and falls out onto the surface of Titan.
Not liquid water, but liquid methane.
On Earth, methane is a flammable gas, but the temperatures on Titan are so cold, minus 1 80 degrees Celsius, that the methane can form liquid.
Titan actually has lakes, rain and rivers made of liquid natural gas, liquid methane.
That probably isn't quite as good as water, but at least it's a medium.
Things can flow around, begin to form bonds.
Fluid is where it's at.
The idea that life can emerge from a different kind of liquid is adding a whole new dimension to our search.
It's possible that life elsewhere in the universe can thrive with other liquids, not just water, and so we have to keep our eyes open.
Other environments very different from that on the Earth could harbour life.
New discoveries constantly shift our perspective on where alien life might exist.
And as we continue investigating the clues to this cosmic mystery, we have to remember to keep an open mind.
Because life out there might be stranger than Hollywood could have ever dreamt up.
The hunt for life in the cosmos is intensifying.
New discoveries have opened us up to the possibility that life could exist closer than we ever imagined, right in our own solar system.
But even if that doesn't pan out, there are billions of stars out there just like our sun
with potentially billions of planets harbouring life, like Earth.
It's completely reasonable to think that there's life out there.
There's just so many possibilities - billions of stars and billions of galaxies, and dah-duh, dah-duh, dah-duh.
surely there's life out there.
Finding life, even primitive microbial life, would change our place in the universe by telling us that we're not alone.
And it would most likely be an indication that we're getting closer to finding an intelligent civilisation.
It would be really fun if we could find an alien that could, you know, send me an email or twitter or whatever, all day long, but the profound question is life or nonlife.
Once we have the microbial, we have the potential for intelligence.
But if we don't have a life form at all, we don't have the potential for anything.
What if we do find complex life out there?
What would it look like?
Would it be anything like what we see in Hollywood movies?
It is humorous that Hollywood depicts aliens more or less the same way.
There's a Klingon here and a Romulan there and there's slanty eyes and, you know, big old brains and so on.
Any sort of alien that resembles a human is ludicrous - two eyes, a nose, and a mouth.
There's no reason an alien would have to be adapted this way.
Over hundreds of millions of years, all the creatures of our planet have adapted to their environment, so the chemistries are similar, which means your genetic makeup isn't all that different from an earthworm, or even your pet.
Basically, all animals are worms.
We're worms - we've got a head, we've got a tail.
We're long and skinny and that's how we move forward.
Dinosaurs are worms.
What people don't understand is that evolution is not a road map.
Humans are not at the top of the evolutionary ladder.
We're not the end point, the goal of evolution, or anything like that.
We're accidents, we're random.
We eat through our mouths but we breathe through our mouths and we can choke on food.
That's a terrible design.
It's an accident of evolution.
Maybe aliens evolved differently.
Maybe they don't need to breathe.
Maybe they can get oxygen in some other way.
Anything like that can go, as long as it makes sense for the environment.
so life on another planet would adapt to its environment and could be stranger than you could ever imagine.
It's fun to speculate about how life might evolve under conditions that are very different from those here on the earth.
If you lived on a planet with twice the gravity of Earth, there'd be a lot more pull on your body and you'd come crashing down twice as hard if you fell.
so perhaps creatures there would have stronger, stockier bodies with more legs closer to the ground.
A planet with very little gravity would be like our moon or Mars.
I can imagine a creature on a low gravity planet as being... long and spindly.
Life on a low gravity planet might be tall and thin, with long legs.
If life evolved on a very dense planet where the atmosphere is soupy or water-like, you could see creatures as big as whales or elephants actually flying, not through the air, but through this liquid-like atmosphere.
I think we are currently ignorant, actually, about the real realistic diversity of life elsewhere.
Life in the universe may be incredibly diverse.
But could it all have come from the same place?
Panspermia is the idea espoused at the beginning of the classic Battlestar Galactica that life here began out there.
The building blocks of life on our planet may have originated elsewhere and were transported here when a meteorite collided with Earth.
Comets have a lot of organic materials on them.
some meteorites have amino acids in them.
These are the building blocks, the precursors, of life.
so at least the building blocks of life could have come from space.
It seems unimaginable because life, or the building blocks of life, would have had to survive an impact with our planet.
Here at nasa's Ames Research Center in northern California, astronomer Peter schultz and his team are testing to see if this theory of Panspermia is even remotely possible.
It's good.
Here I've got the projectile that is embedded with some organics.
so the real question is; will this survive if we hammer it at a high speed?
We're gonna be firing this at around three-and-a-half kilometres per second.
This would be about the speed of something surviving entry into the atmosphere.
schultz will create a high-speed impact using nasa's vertical gun, which will fire the projectile at 1 6,000 kilometres per hour, that's ten times faster than a bullet.
This is a pretty special gun.
It uses a lot of gunpowder but then compresses hydrogen gas, and then it's released, and then the hydrogen gas expands.
When it expands, the projectile continues on down into the impact chamber and that's when things happen.
This is where it all happens.
This is the impact chamber.
The projectile's gonna come through this hole, slam into this target, which is about two feet across - this is just ordinary sand - and we'll see if it survives.
With the vertical gun loaded and the impact chamber set, it's time to test and see if the organic material laced onto the projectile can survive a high-speed impact.
This drives me nuts.
Oh!
OK.
This was...gorgeous.
Whoa!
I... I hope there's stuff left.
The key now is to go back in there, dig out these pieces and see if we can find any survivors, literally survivors.
We gotta go see what we did.
Oh, what a mess.
Oh, this is dynamite.
schultz scours the impact chamber, hunting for remnants of the projectile.
This is like looking for your lost contact on a beach.
Let's see what we have.
Oh, that is so sweet.
We did the experiment, we collected some pieces.
We showed that we actually got solid pieces that survived impact, and embedded within that solid piece are amino acids.
You can see it here in this image.
You can see the fracturing, but even though it's fractured, it's not melted.
Panspermia is not that far-fetched after all.
It says you can transport the seeds of life, if not life itself, from one planet to another.
However life began on our planet, it eventually evolved to develop intelligence.
And ultimately, our goal is to see if that's happened somewhere else in the universe.
What we're really looking for is, you know, spock.
We're looking for another civilisation that's either like us or not like us, but is clearly intelligent.
That's the Holy Grail of the search for extraterrestrial intelligence.
With so many stars and so many planets out there, it would truly be a surprise if intelligent life did not exist somewhere in the universe, perhaps even nearby in our own galaxy.
With the closest stars light years away, is it possible to actually travel there?
Or will first contact be made some other way?
Right now, in our own Milky Way galaxy alone, there may be numerous intelligent alien civilisations.
But why haven't we contacted or been contacted by any of them?
First of all, there's a lot of empty space out there.
The very nearest star to us is four light years away.
They could send us a signal, in four years' time it would get here, and then we could reply eight years later to them.
That's the closest star.
What about communicating with people across the galaxy where there are tens of thousands or a hundred thousand light years in between?
If we wanted to pop over and borrow a cup of sugar, it would take some 700,000 years for us to bring the sugar home.
so that's a very big problem.
With the nearest star 400 trillion kilometres away, our current technology could get us there in, say, 1 00,000 years, so travelling to see an alien civilisation clearly isn't going to work.
But how about we just call them up?
After all, radio signals travel at the speed of light.
If we are going to communicate with aliens, that's gonna be the most boring conversation we've ever had, because if they're beaming radio waves at us and they're 1 00 light years away, and they say, "Hey, how's the weather down there on Earth?"
It takes a hundred years to get here and we say,
"Hey, it's fine.
How are things there on Globnarp?"
Another hundred years back and forth.
It's a century travel time.
That's a boring conversation.
The chances that two intelligent civilisations have the ability to communicate, the desire to communicate, and are around long enough to communicate makes this cosmic chat even tougher.
so we've been intelligent in the sense we've had the same brain size for about 1 00,000 years.
Yet we've only been able to communicate for the past 50 years - a tiny fraction, meaning if another civilisation communicated with us 200 years ago, we would have missed the signal altogether.
There can be a lot of miscommunications when trying a cosmic chat.
We could think of communicating with an alien civilisation as like a game of cosmic catch.
The stadium...is the galaxy.
And the ball is our message.
so if we send the ball out into the stadium, odds are nobody's there to receive it.
Of course, we could luck out and actually send our message towards an alien civilisation.
But what if that civilisation was technologically 500 years or more behind where we are?
Well, that would be like throwing a baseball to a baby.
Of course, if everything is just right and there is another technological civilisation out there capable of receiving our message...
Here you go.
Well, that would be our first contact with an extraterrestrial civilisation.
since it would be a long time before we could have a face-to-face conversation, the best thing we can do for now isjust to listen.
At the search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence, seth shostack is doing just that.
These are the individual antennas of the Allen telescope array. It's one of the most powerful observatories in the world and, in fact, the kind of thing that could check out millions of star systems.
If you can check out a few million star systems, you have a really good chance of finding a signal from ET.
Radio waves or TV signals have recognisable patterns, so shostack and other scientists are listening for deliberate signals from an alien planet.
These telescopes listen to hundreds of thousands to millions of stars at the same time and they do it 24 hours a day.
These distances between stars are enormously vast.
Most interstellar visiting is gonna be via signalling, not by actual visiting.
And what are we broadcasting out into the cosmos?
Television transmissions have been travelling away from the earth for about 50 years.
I Love Lucy and Gilligan's Island have been broadcast to the galaxy, travelling at the speed of light, and they are our emissaries, they are our diplomats to the galaxy.
Our ultra-high frequency and microwave radio signals have been expanding into space at the speed of light.
These radio, radar, and television signals fill a sphere nearly 1 00 light years in diameter, so any civilisation within 1 00 light years of Earth might be hearing our voices or watching our television shows.
We're sending transmissions out into the cosmos, but suppose we detect a signal from an alien civilisation.
How would we respond?
It's something we've thought about a lot.
The United Nations has even drawn up a manifesto about what we would do.
When the day comes that we pick up a transmission from an alien civilisation, we as a species, frankly, will face our greatest challenge ever, I think.
It raises the question, who represents Earth?
Who represents the Homo sapiens?
And I think the only way to decide this will be with some very seriously thought-out process.
But if we do pick up a signal from an alien race, not everyone thinks it's such a good idea to answer back.
There will be those who, I think, understandably, will argue that we humans should remain hidden in the great galactic tall grasses, because, of course, maybe they're hungry, for example, and would like some hors d'oeuves.
Would aliens really want to do us harm?
Probably not.
Aliens we contact will at least have learned to live with themselves peacefully.
For them to exist in any numbers in the galaxy, they would have to have long lifetimes as intelligent, technological, communicating civilisations.
We are closer than ever to finding answers to one of mankind's greatest questions..
Are we alone?
There is something in us that wants to find our place.
What is our purpose?
Maybe that purpose is just to be nice to each other and just to seek and explore and to discover.
We are exploring and every discovery we make will help us understand our very existence.
We want to be a part of something bigger than ourselves.
We know deep down that our lives are flickering moments of glory.
We would like to know that there's a higher purpose, that we're a part of something bigger.
Are we simply one small piece in the cosmicjigsaw puzzle or are we truly the only special beings in this vast universe?
Finding the answer could be mankind's greatest challenge.
Previously on Siberia...
A tiger!
A fucking tiger!
I couldn't believe it.
It was like something a seven year old would tell me...
"Oh, I saw a tiger in the woods..."
- What are you doing?
- Wondering what would do that to a tiger.
Oh, hell.
It's on fire...
and it's green...
- What's on fire?
- The sky.
You know, there's something about Carolina.
I feel like I recognize her.
- Fire in the woods, man.
- Got to get some water.
I told you this was a mistake!
That's all we had, man.
That's all we had.
Does anyone recognize this?
We found Johnny's shirt.
And it was full of food from the shed.
I get what it looks like.
I see that.
But I didn't steal the food, and I didn't burn down the shed.
Someone obviously doesn't like me, and they're trying to set me up.
People weren't taking too kindly me being at camp 'cause apparently I stole food from the shed and then burned it down.
Someone framed me. They wrapped my shirt around some food, hid it in the woods.
I don't know who did it.
You know, frankly, I don't really care anymore, you know?
I don't really need them anyways.
You know, obviously, I can take care of myself.
Took them how long to build a fire?
I did it in five minutes in the dark.
I can't believe Johnny's gonna just stay out in the woods.
And why shouldn't he?
After all the crap that he's pulled?
He'll be fine.
And if he's not, you got a better chance of winning.
And you can keep his bed.
I want to make it to the end, but I want to do it as a team, kind of like how Neeko's doing it, you know?
Can I tell you something?
Sure.
You're a smart guy.
You know that Neeko is a professional athlete?
He plays game for living.
How about maybe he's playing this game that he's a very nice guy, everybody trusts him, just to win the game?
Have you ever thought about it?
I don't think you should trust him.
Can't trust anybody.
Guys?
I get up early, and as soon as I open the door, I practically ran into this spear that's stuck in the ground.
It felt like a threat.
Let me see.
What does it say?
It says...
What is that?
It means "get out."
It's just another thing to throw on the pile of what the hell's going on here.
It's a nice prop.
Look at it.
It's not real.
Nice scare tactic.
They're watching.
I'm sure they're loving this.
Why is it in front of our cabin and not yours?
Who wants you guys to get out?
Well, this is here on purpose.
That's for sure.
It's here on purpose.
It's here for a reason.
You guys gonna be so gullible to fall for this, really?
Who else could've left that spear?
Besides Production, who could've done it?
We're the only people out here.
Aren't we?
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.
I mean, aren't you still scared?
The spear this morning telling us to leave?
That doesn't scare you at all?
I think, at this point, it's just all mind games.
I miss home.
I miss my family.
I even miss my stupid ex-boyfriend.
This place is-- it's getting to me.
I don't know.
I'm thinking about pushing the button.
I don't want you to go.
You know what I mean?
I think-- I think we can win this.
We just need to--
But I don't need to stay.
I don't understand why I'm even staying.
I don't need the money that badly.
I do.
Annie.
I've been a lone wolf for a while, you know?
I've been on my own for a while.
I'm probably, without knowing it, less lonely than I have been in a long time because I'm interacting with people more often than I have in many years.
Now I consider Daniel a friend.
He's a good kid.
If I had a son, I'd be proud if he was like Daniel.
What are you looking at?
- Just watching those two. - Mm-hmm.
I don't want to overstep my bounds, you know.
I don't know how she feels about me, and so I'm just kind of--
I'm taking it slow, but at the same time, it's really hard 'cause I really want to, you know, see where this is gonna go.
I don't know.
At the same time, I don't want to get hurt.
Don't worry.
She knows you exist.
How would I really get her to?
I don't know, like...
Get her to what?
Like me like me.
You can't get her to like you.
Either she does or she doesn't.
You know?
How beautiful is it?
This is so nice.
_
Why not?
_
I'm sorry.
I'm being naughty.
It's beautiful in, though.
_
You must be hot.
Come on.
_
- No good... _
- No one's here.
- It's trouble.
No one's here.
I'm not gonna tell anyone.
You want to come.
- Oh, yeah?
_
You'll thank me once you're in here.
It's beautiful.
_
Careful.
_
I'm gonna film us.
_
It's a great idea.
You promise you'll erase it?
_
- Promise me?
- I promise.
Good.
Annie?
Wait, Annie.
You shouldn't be walking out here alone.
It's not safe.
_
What are you talking about?
Come on, it's not safe.
Stop.
Wait.
Don't be like this.
Be like what?
Look, I--
It's not the same thing for me, okay?
I'm not going back to a life or a job that I like or family or friends or even an ex-boyfriend, and I get that you're sad about that.
But you're forgetting about who's here for you right now, and you're turning your back on me.
No, I'm not.
I like her.
It's been a while since I've been with anybody, but I--
We get along so well.
I just feel like a dumbass now.
I mean, she's probably not gonna talk to me for the rest of the time, if she does stay.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- There you are.
- How's it going?
Good.
I just wanted to talk to you.
Uh-huh?
Um, so, Victoria's gone.
Um, I'm just wondering what's going on with her bed.
Oh, it's-- well, it's free right now.
So no one would mind if I moved in?
Um... yeah, yeah.
I mean, I don't mind. I don't know what the other girls other think, but it's good with me.
Awesome.
All right, I'll go grab my things.
It's not that I didn't have fun with the boys.
I don't know.
I just feel like my time there is done.
It's served its purpose, and I want to--
I want to get to know the girls a bit better.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- What are you doing?
- I'm leaving.
You mean the show?
No, you idiot.
I'm gonna move into Victoria's old bed.
Wait.
Why?
Why?
Because it's free.
I know, but I thought you liked it here with me.
You said we are great roommates.
Yes, we were, and thank you for letting me stay.
Just, I don't know.
I want to be with the girls now.
Come on, Esther.
Don't you think we should team up?
We are both smarter than everyone else here.
We can win this thing-- together.
Ohh, I like your style.
I will think about it.
But hold on.
Hold on. Hold on.
I was just thinking that we could have something...
You thought what?
That we could get romantic a little bit?
Don't laugh.
Really?
I don't do romance.
Look, we're playing a game.
What do you mean?
I'm playing a game-- for money.
I don't do romance, and I'm not playing a dating game.
I'm sorry.
Fuck you, bitch!
Fuck you, bitch!
You're not going anywhere.
Get the fuck off me!
I'm kidding.
I was just kidding, Esther.
I'm just kidding.
Esther.
Don't you fucking touch me again.
Come on!
I'm just- - I was just kidding!
I think I was in shock.
I-I don't know.
It happened so quickly.
But he grabbed me here, pushed me up against the bunk, and then he backed off.
Esther is a player.
We all know that.
And I played with her, too.
So she was on the way out.
I just pushed her a little bit on the bed, just jokingly, like pretending that I'm like scaring her.
"You're gonna stay here," or something.
She just, like, freaked out.
She pushed me away.
She's like, "don't talk to me like that."
Stormed out, like mad.
And I was just telling her, "I'm joking.
You know me.
I always joke around.
I was just joking with you."
I didn't get it, seriously.
She just freaked out, and it was just a pure joke.
What are you showing me?
It was right here.
Are you sure?
Big huge carcass.
Guts hanging out and everything.
Look.
Look at what?
The blood?
It could've been anything.
It could've been a bird.
It could've been a deer.
Why would I make this up?
Why would I lie?
There was a huge-- there was a huge tiger there.
I guess they took it.
The producers took it.
The producers?
I think she thinks that I could've been trying to scare her, play a sick joke on her.
I was kind of a bit shocked because I didn't think she saw me as that kind of person.
For all I know, Johnny took it. Johnny took it?
He probably dragged it off into there and hid it or something.
I don't know.
Oh, now Johnny does everything?
Not only do we have to worry about the producers playing mind games with us, we got to worry about that guy.
Hopefully he's done us all a favor and gone and pushed the button to get out of here.
I don't think he's as bad as you think.
Why are you always defending him?
Why are you always defending him?
I'm telling you that guy's dangerous.
I'm kind of baffled where it's gone, you know, 'cause this thing was pretty big, you know.
It would've taken a lot of force or something pretty hefty to get it out of there, and there was no trail.
There was no kind of like a trail of where it could've been dragged to.
It's like it was almost picked up and gone.
Got some traps set up along this way somewhere.
I found some deer trails I scouted earlier.
Hope they catch something.
The first night in the woods by myself was pretty awesome, actually.
Had a nice little fire.
Weather was nice.
You know, wrapped up.
It was nice being on my own.
It's what I wanted to do originally, too, is, you know, be by myself, take care of myself, do my own thing, and I got that, so pretty content.
What the hell did this, man?
This thing's...
I mean, it, obviously, it ripped the deer while it was standing here.
It was strong enough to rip it off-- rip the, like, rip its bone in half.
What do you want?
What are you doing?
I'm trying to catch some food, but something got to it before me, it looks like.
What do you want?
I just came to try to convince you to come back.
Try to convince me to come back, to the camp?
Yeah, I don't think it's safe for you to be out here.
I think it's safer here than being back at camp where a bunch of people don't like me thanks to you, making those wild accusations.
Just, whatever happened, I don't think it's safe for you to stay out here.
Well, you know what?
I really don't need you trying to be nice to me.
I'll be fine on my own, okay?
I can take care of myself.
Y'all try taking care of yourselves, too, all right?
Okay, fine.
If that's how you want to be, then fine.
Fine.
Nah, that's-- that's not good enough.
That ain't good enough.
Hey, Irene.
Hey, Dan.
Whatcha doing?
Collecting some acorns.
- Oh.
- Yeah.
If you mash them up, you can make like a paste and make a pancake out of it.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Is it-- does it taste good?
I think so.
You want me to help?
Oh, sure.
That'd be great.
Yeah.
They're kind of scattered all over.
Daniel is a really, really nice, really sweet person, and he has such a gentle-- a very gentle spirit,
I guess you can say.
Hey.
It's a Siberian squill.
I'm not really big on flowers.
Why not?
Well, you know, they're pretty, but it's kind of odd, the whole idea of someone giving someone a flower 'cause it's like, "Oh, you know, I like you, so let me give you something that's dying."
It never really made sense to me.
Something more permanent would be nice, you know, even a rock would be better.
She's got so much complexity to her, you know?
I find out something new about her every day, it seems like, and it's a pretty big thing that I would've never expected out of her.
It's...
She's just-- she's amazing.
Where are we?
I can't find the path.
We're lost.
- We're not lost.
- No, we're lost.
I don't know where we're going.
In the middle of the wood, very close to the river, I found this really weird-looking tree.
I mean, it wasn't a tree.
It was something different.
It had a face shape.
It had hair.
What?
My name is Miljan.
It's really nice to meet you.
What is your name?
Ogdee?
This is my friend Ogdee.
We go way back, man.
He's so bad.
I spoke to it.
We had a little conversation.
Ogdee is my old friend from high school.
I'm kidding.
Esther.
- What?
_
_
_ _
_ _
_
_
_ _
_
_
_ _
_
_
_
_
Where have you been?
Out.
Out?
Where do you go all day, anyway?
Okay.
I can't believe you got us so lost.
We're not lost.
Yes, we are.
Where are we?
Do you know where we are?
We're in Siberia.
Not funny.
Oh, God!
What is that?
Did you hear that?
I heard it.
Come on.
There might be something out here.
Come on.
Oh! Oh, God!
What are you doing out here?
Sorry.
I'm going to get water.
Where are you going?
Home-- where the hell is it?
That way.
Why is she being such a bitch?
Why are you here, by the way, alone?
No reason.
That's suspicious.
Shut up, Miljan.
Guys, have you seen Carolina?
No.
She hasn't come back.
You mean she's not back yet?
She's not back.
I have no idea where she is.
I haven't seen her.
You do know she's out there with Johnny?
Yeah, tell me about it.
I know.
Well, I don't know about you, but I feel like I should go and look for her.
I don't-- I don't feel comfortable with her with Johnny.
Before it gets too late, I think we should.
I'm game, yeah.
- You're gonna come with me?
- Yeah.
Gentlemen.
Where the hell were you?
I was in the woods.
Have you seen Carolina? She's out there with Johnny.
Oh, she'll be fine, guys.
- Come on.
- Are you serious?
Yes.
They're probably having sex or something. Oh, you're a funny guy.
Don't be naive.
You didn't notice the chemistry they had?
Hey, guys, listen.
I'm gonna look for her.
I don't know about you.
Just sitting here talking.
Hey, it's dark outside.
Oh, fuck!
Get on the bed. Get onto the bed!
The bed?
Oh, my God.
What is this?
The cab started shaking...
Ran outside, and the sky this just this odd color that I've never seen in my life, and I'm thinking it can't be the show doing this because that's way out of their powers and their control.
What is it?
It's like-- it's like the sky's on fire.
What?
It's like the sky's on fire.
The sky went from dark to light, and it looked like it was on fire, just like Victoria said.
If this is all part of the game, it's beyond me at this point.
I don't understand how they could pull it off.
I feel like I'm on another planet.
I feel like I walked into some kind of a dream or a nightmare, and nobody-- nobody has any answers.
I don't have an answer.
I could sit here all day long and just-- it's way above my pay scale.
- Is it moving?
- It just keeps moving.
Carolina never came back today, did she?
Yeah.
Where-- where are they?
She's still in the woods-- the forest.
Well, this can't stop us.
We still have to find her.
We can't leave her out there.
We better go now.
We're just gonna go look for her-- me and Sam, Daniel, Miljan as well.
Oh, my God.
Carolina?
Carolina.
Are you okay?
What happened?
Oh, my God.
Carolina!
- What happened?
Are you okay?
- Are you okay?
Then we see Carolina stumbling towards the girls' cabin, and the girls go rushing over to her.
Are you hurt somewhere?
- What happened?
- Look at all the blood.
What happened?
She's bleeding.
Guys, don't, don't-- don't go to her.
Oh, my God, look at her arm.
Look at her arm.
What happened to you?
You're okay.
Carolina, what happened?
Carolina shows up, and she's battered and disoriented.
She couldn't even speak.
She's trembling.
I don't...
She doesn't remember.
You don't remember?
What do you remember?
She didn't know what was going on.
She was saying she couldn't even, like, remember what she'd been doing out there.
She was just talking nonsense, and it was really jolting to see her come back like that.
_
You were with John?
- And what happened?
- Where is he?
What were you doing with Johnny?
Get her some water.
Get her some help.
Carolina, were you with Johnny?
She said she was.
What were you doing with Johnny?
_
_
She said the name "Johnny."
At that point, I just, you know, lost it.
Listen to me.
Listen to me. Listen to me.
For what?
Here, just come here.
Come here.
I want to say something to you.
- What?
- Listen to me!
It's important.
You got to make sure.
You look at his hands.
Okay.
His hands are a tell-tale sign, okay?
His hands will tell you if he did something.
What are you doing?
Where are you going?
Stay here with the girls.
Stay here with the girls!
I'm not wasting any more time with this guy.
Everyone wants to keep him around, thinking,
"Oh, yeah, he'll turn around and be a good guy."
No, I don't think so.
I'm not gonna lay around waiting for him to come stab me in the back.
- She's been through a lot.
- Yeah.
We're gonna look after you, okay?
Don't worry.
We don't know where Johnny is.
Carolina sort of-- she couldn't say much, but she said that she was-- they were fighting-- her and Johnny were fighting.
And then, now she looks like this, so Johnny should be probably fearing for his life right now because Sam and Neeko went after him.
Let's just keep moving.
Move. Move.
_
The whole walking through the woods and hearing noises coming from places that, you know--
We stop and we look, and there's nothing there.
It's just this whole atmosphere that everything just feels like you're being watched, you know.
Whether, you know, whether you're in the woods or in the cabin, you always feel like something is watching you, and the past two nights, I haven't slept very well, you know.
So I'm just-- you know, you're always looking over your shoulder.
You always think something's there, and, like, the whole thing with the sky now...
I don't know.
Well, he's obviously around here somewhere.
Yes.
You keep saying "he," "he."
Look how thick the brush is here.
If there's somebody around here, we'd see them.
We hear other things.
All of a sudden, something goes flying.
I think we should be talking more in the sense of "what."
I'll go see if the water's boiled.
Thank you.
I don't want to die.
I didn't ever expect that that would be a possibility on this show, and every day that I'm here, I feel like I'm an idiot for staying, that I am gonna end up like Tommy.
I don't deal well with-- Abuse is not something that...
I can handle right now.
I'm scared.
And Johnny was already on the outs with the group for stealing food.
I just-- How could he do that to her?
It didn't make sense.
She's such a nice lady.
Johnny.
Hey. What did you do?
- Huh?
- What did you do to Carolina?
I don't know what you're talking about.
What do you mean you don't know what I'm talking about?
- What'd you do to her?
- I didn't--
She's all cut up and shit.
I don't- - I don't know. I...
What's wrong with you?
I don't know.
I just- - I kind of came to.
I was walking around, and...
I don't know.
I was- - I saw her.
You saw her where?
You got to tell me what happened.
We were in the woods, and...
I don't really-- I don't really remember.
I get approached by Daniel, and basically started accusing me of hurting Carolina.
I didn't know what to say.
What did you to do her?
!
The last thing she remembers is getting in a fight with you, so you can't come back here and tell me that you didn't touch her!
I don't.
Then what happened to her?
I don't know.
That's not a very good answer right now, man.
I don't-- trust me.
Hey.
You hear that?
At the camp.
Let's go.
I don't know.
Are you serious?
You don't know?
You're such a scumbag.
Oh, what?
So she just fell down and ended up that way?
Are you kidding me?
I was in a complete haze.
I had no recollection.
I was like blacked out, like I drank too much.
He doesn't look like he knows what's going on.
I don't.
- Then what happened to her?
- I don't know.
I don't know.
You were together, weren't you?
- You said that.
- Shit!
Neeko!
Neeko!
Guys, he doesn't know!
- Motherfucker!
- Come on! Stop it!
- Stop! Stop it!
- Come on!
Stop it!
Neeko, stop it!
He didn't do it!
Carolina starts screaming, "It's not him.
He didn't do it."
Stop it!
What do you mean?
You said you don't remember.
You said you don't remember.
You're a dead man.
You're a fucking dead man.
Listen. Listen.
Hey, hey.
Hey!
Calm down.
Listen.
- What happened?
- I don't know.
Talk to me.
I don't know.
Johnny doesn't know anything?
He doesn't remember anything.
It was just her and him in the forest.
I know that.
I know that.
I saw it in his eyes, okay?
All I remember is I talked to her.
We were arguing.
And then I-I came here, and I started getting accused, and I don't even know what the fuck is going on.
If we caught him in the woods, he would've been dead.
When I saw that look in his eyes, I just felt that I needed to take a step back.
Remember the way she came into camp?
He's got the same look on his face.
Does she remember anything?
Show us your hands.
Oh, yeah.
I've seen that before.
What's that from?
Nothing's making sense here.
And just to be angry and become a bunch of animals--
We can't go killing each other.
We're still human beings.
I don't like things that I can't explain and that I don't have at least some sort of control over.
The sky changing color and looking like fire-- the producers, the show can't do that.
We're talking supernatural stuff now.
Regardless of everything else, that's real, and that scared the hell out of me.
It seems like everybody at camp was convinced that I was the person that hurt her.
I've never hit a woman in my life.
I don't know why I would.
I don't remember anything, but...
I can't say that I didn't 'cause I don't--
I don't know what happened.
But I know in my heart I wouldn't do that.
I don't remember anything.
All I remember is that I was... with--
Went to get Johnny.
He was in the woods.
I found him, and I...
It's all one big blur, like one big blackout.
I have all these marks on my body, and my shirt is broken, and I don't remember.
I don't understand.
So you're telling me this is real.
Yes.
It looks like it's native, handmade.
It looks like it's just a prop to me.
Well, if it's a prop, it's really well-made 'cause you see the barbs.
They're curved.
That's exactly how it should look.
This is ox.
It's real ox.
And it's balanced for throwing.
It just looks perfect.
It's your choice to believe in it or not, but this is real, so...
I don't have to deal with lies in figuring out what is true, what is not.
I have to know the environment I'm in.
I have to know what's out there in order to protect myself and survive.
Look at this.
So, I found this symbol that is really strange.
It has four lines and little triangles on the ends.
Then I found another one and another one, and I realized it's a path.
I should follow them.
At the end, it was very close to the settlement.
I found the last one.
And I found this box.
It was a metal box.
I opened it, and it was a book.
I didn't understand anything because it was in a different language.
I would assume it's Russian because it's cyrillic letters.
In the middle of me looking at it, somebody was watching at me.
It was a person.
He's staring at me.
And he just disappeared in a second.
So there are people out there.
Hey.
I was just gonna try and make things better, and, like, apologize, and just wanted to let her know that I didn't, you know,
I didn't want to screw anything up or make anything awkward for her.
I guess I was in a weird mood, and I just want to apologize because I don't want to make you feel uncomfortable or anything, because I'm really glad you're--
When I realized what Annie's real feelings were for me, I just thought... "I'm sort of open to love in any form right now."
So I kissed her.
Which I kind of surprised myself at, to be honest.
Don't worry about it.
Hey.
Hey.
Can I have a seat?
How are you feeling?
I'm okay.
You?
I wanted to go check on her to see how she was doing 'cause I knew she had scratches and stuff on her, and she was sure freaked out like I was.
Do you remember anything from last night?
No.
I don't remember a thing.
I don't remember anything either.
But I know you didn't hurt me.
I would never hurt you.
Can I ask you something, though?
Why'd you set me up?
With the shed and the food?
She couldn't even look me in the eye.
And I was like, "Well..."
I was like, "It tells me all I need to know,"
so I was like-- got the hell out of there.
Johnny.
Johnny.
Stop, please.
Johnny, wait for me.
- Give me a break.
Oh, my God.
- Hey.
I know that.
I know that.
- Johnny.
- I know that.
You're an actress.
She said, like, this slogan.
Like, "I know that. I know that from somewhere."
And then it just-- the light bulb went off.
Yeah, that's like your slogan.
She's that actress from that show that--
I'm like, "That's how I know you."
I didn't want to do that.
I didn't want-
- I asked them.
You didn't want to do what?
I didn't want to burn it down.
I didn't want to set you up.
They told me to.
Who's they?
The producers.
So you're-- you're helping the show?
Episode 4
"Memory Loss", where on earth are you now?
Gods of heaven and earth ...
I didn't do anything wrong, please.
Shaman!
What's wrong?
Young Master.
Did No-Memory come by here?
She came and left!
Where did she go to?
Where, you ask?
She went to the Underworld.
What, the Underworld?
This time, she went for real.
Crazy ghost.
She said farewell to me before she left.
She must be really insane.
Saying that she wanted to meet the Jade Emperor, she threatened the Reaper...
Crazy, she's crazy.
I'm sure she won't be safe in the Underworld.
At least now I'm free.
Mother, Grandmother, Elders...
Truthfully, I was desperate, so I just took a gamble, but do you also die?
Nothing in this world lasts forever.
What?
So grim reapers die as well?
Is that true?
If you die, where do you go?
I just... disappear.
Disappear?
Is disappearing a big deal?
How long were you a reaper for?
Were you born as a reaper?
Or did you also have a previous life?
It's just because I have a very curious nature.
This is the River Styx.
Once you cross it, you will not be able to come back.
Do you have any regrets?
I didn't say farewell.
Just keep your promise.
Get in.
Look here, Memory Loss!
Did you lie to me?
!
Hell?
The crimes she made in this world are not light at all.
But those are still excusable.
In terms of our law, it's enough if she gets flogged about 1,000 times, spends a year in a prison and then will be released.
If she turns herself in, after 100 times of flogging, she can regain the hope.
Of course, the sins she committed during her life time are calculated seperately.
But the crime she committed today.. has no excuse at all.
Threatening the Reaper and acting like that... there will be no trial, and will instantly be brought to hell.
But, how does a shaman know that?
You don't even have supernatural powers.
It's all in the book!
Isn't that a quack B-list story book?
Do you think our "Mu Jwe Ja Ji Ok Ark Wi Chook Saeng Soo Ra Moon Jeon Dang Dang Too Seok Seo" is a joke?
What is hell like?
How could it be like?
There are no words that could describe it.
As per our "Mu Jwe Ja Ji Ok Ark Wi Chook Saeng Soo Ra Moon Jeon Dang Dang Too Seok Seo", there are total of 10 kinds of hells.
there are total of 10 kinds of hells. Every single one of them is so horrible.
Being swallowed or fried is just the basic.
"Geo Hae" Hell, where the people are cut by saws.
You've heard of the expression, "piercing wind".
There is "Poong Do" Hell, where your body is torn and pierced by real sword wind.
Anyway, there are all kinds of hells.
She must have behaved like that because she didn't know what the hells are like.
If she knew, would she have been defiant like that although she was so desperate?
I, I mean, we... can't do anything here?
Aigo... what can humans do instead of her?
Why?
Do you want to go in her stead?
No way.
Nobody can go to the toilet and the underworld in other's stead.
I wonder if she's able to withstand Hell at all.
I'm only saying this now, but she may seem strong, but her heart was probably full of fear
I may not know your situation, how can this happen to a young Lady like you?
And you don't even have your Mom or Dad.
It's not that I have any desires to be a Magistrate or anything, but looking at you right now, my heart just hurts.
Hurry, hurry!
It's this way!
W-w-w-hat?
You guys...
What is wrong with you guys?
I'm telling you to move aside!
You, old man..
What do you mean, move aside? !
You punk!
Are you not going to move aside?
It is Lord Choi's order!
Lord...
Choi?
Now you already understand, what are you doing and not moving aside?
Does Lord Choi raise bandits?
How can he order you to come to the Government office at night and attack?
You punk!
You think your life line would be as tough as silk thread!
I don't know if my life line is tough, but... I know that I have to protect this place! I know that I have to protect this place!
You punk!
What nonsense are you spouting!
Get out from there, now!
This... bastard!
You old men! Shame on you!
How can Governmental officers conspire with bandits and attack the office?
That punk must have eaten something bad!
What are you all doing?
!
Stop fighting and just come over here!
I don't want to!
This is mine!
No one can lay their hands on her!
Is he crazy or what? !
If you want to come in, you should step on me first!
To a crazy dog, a knife is the medicine.
Even if I kill such a punk like you, I won't be locked in a jail.
This was just an appetitizer.
Oh, hey...
Young Master!
Hey, you.
Get me my shoes.
I knew you'd be like this.
That young master didn't look like talking an empty word.
What?
What are you going to do?
You want to have one round of fight against me?
It's not like I can't do that. (informal)
Seo?
(The other guy ended his sentence with -seo, which is very informal. An ordinary man can't talk to a nobleman informally)
You punk now dare to put your knife at my neck, the youngest son of Kim Eung Boo, who used to be Minister of Education and the former prime minister?
It looks like you only believe in Lord Choi, but your backing is Lord Choi, not yourself.
If something goes wrong with me, my father will kill you, not Lord Choi.
So, lower your gaze and lower your knife.
Take all of these men and get lost!
You punk!
You should do your bowing greetings before you go. (bowing is a form of very formal greeting)
That's right, that's right.
Let's meet again next time.
Young Master!
Oh, Dol Soe!
You protected her well!
You did well!
You did great!
Hey there, Memory Loss.
What would you want me to do?
A... funeral?
We are having a proper funeral for her, so prepare accordingly.
Then... what kind of material should we use for the coffin?
Juniper wood is quite expensive, so what about Paulowniawood...?
Receive the condolers' visits too.
The condolers...?
But, she doesn't have any family or friends, so who would come...
What do you mean who?
Just let the town people know.
Tell them to come and bow with their sincere minds, asking her forgiveness for their badmouthing.
I'm not sure if those can be forgiven, though.
Yes.
Memory Loss, this is the only thing I can do.
I wish that your body at least rests in peace.
After your funeral, I am leaving this place.
Well, My Lord, I don't think that this matter requires your personal involvement.
Then we will go one more time, and this time, we'll make sure--
Forget it!
My Lord!
He would hold a funeral obediently?
Yes, as of today, he would accept condolers' visits and bury her on the third day.
Talking about a murder case or what-not, didn't he seem to make the case big?
Well, he's always changing his mind so often, so I'm not sure what's his real intention, but in my opinion, maybe he's very regretting about last night's incident...
Later, he must have thought that was a mistake.
Of course, if he is in right mind, he should think so.
However, about the last night's incident, why don't you call him one day and scold harshly?
Then, he won't make a same mistake next time.
What is written here?
It says that there will be funeral for the daughter of the former Magistrate Lee.
It says that we should visit there and ask the forgiveness to the deceased.
Ask the forgiveness?
What about it?
I don't know!
What if we go to the funeral and get picked on by Lord Choi?
Aigo... the new Magistrate knows nothing at all.
By the way, I'm thinking.....
I would talk to the new Magistrate about Bang Nap. (Preparing the tribute for people with some interest)
Honestly, Lord Choi is charging the interest for Bang Nap too high!
Hey, don't ever talk about that!
Do you want to be dragged in secret and killed?
Damn it.
Whether getting beaten to death or starving to death, death is all the same.
Anyway, that Miss' corpse isn't even rotten, I heard.
It's very ominous and uncomfortable.
Why doesn't he bury her right away, making the 3 days of funeral process like this?
Let's go, let's go.
Silly girl... it's been two days and not even an ant came?
You are seriously...
How did you live in this kind of town?
But then, it's a good thing you didn't meet that Young Master last time.
He doesn't even know your face!
What?
You have good eyes to pick a guy?
Did you really go to that place?
Hell?
Aigo, here, tie it tightly.
That's roughly done now.
I wish you a long and healthy life.
After the burial, are you really leaving?
Yes.
There is no reason for me to stay here.
That saying, that Miss could rest peacefully now because of you, Young Master.
But still, even though her household has fallen, how could nobody came to her funeral rites?
Seriously, this town is so "warm-hearted". (sarcastically)
Well, it's not all their fault, though.
It must be because their lives are so tough.
Right, my back pack.
Is your mouth stuck?
You... you...
It's nice seeing you again.
You...
Young Master, let's go.
Oh?
Who are you?
Did you come for condolence?
Since the coffin is about to leave, why don't you go to the burial ground...
Young Master!
Dol Soe, you go ahead.
How can you do that to a person--
GO AHEAD!
What are you doing?
!
Yes!
It's been a long time since I've seen that expression on his face.
Who is she?
It's a face that looks like she came back from the dead.
What kind of relationship do they have?
With a woman...
WOMAN?
!
Wait, so he had a woman without me knowing? !
What are you doing there?
Come, quick!
You... to the Underworld... the Hell...
Dol Soe... you... how...
How did you know that I went to the Underworld?
Ah... the shaman?
What happened to you?
Were you looking for me?
You were worried for me?
Magistrate, you---
What is it? !
I... became a human.
What is wrong with you?
Come with me.
What are you saying?
What do you mean you became a human?
Where is this place?
Arang, what is the reason you want to see me?
What on earth did you put on yourself? (meaning perfume)
The Heavenly Fragrance to greet a woman.
Finally we've met, old man Jade Emperor.
It's me.
Old man... the Jade Emperor?
Take out the "old man" part... in what way am I an old man?
Old man, ha!
Do you think you can fool me?
Just because you appear young...
Arang, mind your manners.
Do you think I've brought my manners with me when I died?
Arang!
That's enough.
Continue.
I came because I have something to ask you.
I want to know why I died and lied under the ground like that.
You did?
You didn't... know?
Aren't you the Jade Emperor?
Look at this human!
How can the Jade Emperor know everything?
Do you know how many people I am responsible for?
How can I be interested ONLY in your situation?
Who do you think you are anyway?
But...
However, if you're that desperate, we will discuss about that.
Earlier, we've reached to our decision, but why are you pretending to discuss?
Just keep your promise with me.
Arang!
Considering your sins, you're immediately going to Hell.
But here, because of the Emperor's earnest request, ....
That's not right.
I'm not in the position to make an "earnest request" to you, aren't I?
Because of his EARNEST REQUEST! We decided to give you one more chance.
This is the first time since the time Heaven was created.
We... will send you back to the world of the living.
Find the answer to your own question and death.
If you can't find the answer, you will be put in the hell of all the hells, and you will suffer all the pains which you can't get away from even after 10 million times of eternity.
If that happens, the only thing you can do there would be just regretting to come here today.
Even so, will you do that?
I'll just do it.
Before the Sky and the Earth were created, there was only one,
Tae Geuk.
(a.k.a. the Yin-Yang, or the Great Ultimate.)
Because of that, the Sky and the Earth, the yin and the yang and the four seasons were created
The reason and natural force, five oceans, and everything was transformed.
The body of the universe... a unique existence, the power of yin and yang!
For the person who was alive during the death and was dead during the life, allow the living body and dead heart!
It worked! It worked!
It did!
The crystal of the soul!
What do you mean "It did?"
From now the problem starts, from now.
Don't worry.
I believe my senses.
Now I will send you.
However. only.. you, the poor soul who knows only the fact that you don't know anything.
Where there is a will, there is a way.
Go and find your truth as much as you want!
Aish!
Isn't he crazy?
!
You twin perverted old men!
You have to give me my clothes!
Hey!
You scared me!
Are you a ghost or a human? !
Hey, storage yard ghost. Guard those sauces and pastes well.
The taste of the sauces depends on how the storage yard ghost works, you know?
Did I really turn into a human now?
If there is any mirror or something like that, I can find out right away
Hey kid, do you see me?
Yea.
How do I look?
You're pretty.
Lee Seo Rim's funeral
... so come and ask for her forgiveness.
- Written by Miryang Magistrate.
Magistrate!
My funeral.
So, the Jade Emperor sent you as a human?
Yea.
To find out the truth about your death by yourself?
Yeah.
Geez...
Why?
No, Why only to you?
I don't know.
I must've have looked that pitiful.
Frankly speaking, how pitiful I am!
So, Magistrate, let's find the truth about my death in earnest...
Young Master, they're saying to hurry up.
Because of you, everybody is doing nothing and waiting for you.
Tell them to leave first.
What's the use of going first? Without the Magistrate.
Where are you going?
To Lee Seo Rim's funeral?
What are you doing in your room?
I'll go into you room.
No!
Don't come in!
I'm going out.
First, stay here and don't go anywhere.
Don't ever go outside.
I'm going in!
Hey! Hey! Hey!
I'm going outside right now!
Aish!
Who is it?
!
I'm asking who it is!
I don't know!
It's not finished yet.
Aish...
I'm... back, Lee Seo Rim.
I really... became a human.
Really.
I give you three months.
The period you can stay in the world of the living is until the third full moon. (meaning "giving three months)
If you can't uncover the truth by then, Your spirit, without following any procedures, will go straight to hell.
If it is the truth or not, how do I know?
If you find the truth... this bell will ring.
Are you kidding?
What is this?
Will I be able to even hear it ring?
Remember it well.
Only the death of the person who led you to the death (the person who killed her) can ring this bell.
Arang!
I will pick the perfect hell for you and prepare it in advance.
Why?
Whatever you do, you can't solve this problem anyway.
What if I succeed?
If I succeed, as if nothing happened... will you let me live in the heavens?
That...
I'll think about it when the time is up.
Those Old men, do you think I can't? !
Why do you give me even three full moons?
One is enough.
I am different than the simple Lee Seo Rim.
I'm not going to just scream without knowing anything.
You are going to be so suprised when I find out the truth then, I'll have you play that bell plenty of times.
Damn, you old men!
The truth...
Honestly, that kid's truth isn't the important thing,
Then... do you really think this plan is going to work?
It's worth to try at least once.
Since you made it a big deal like going down to the world of the living, I thought you had some amazlingly thought out plan.
That kid...is certainly going to be sent to hell.
If so, that means, you will lose to me.
If you lose, you just keep your promise.
Of course I will.
Okay, now, tell me. If you win, what do you want?
Your body.
What?
If I win, you give your body to me. And I'll give you this body.
We'll be switching bodies.
What?
!
Okay then.
If I win, what are you going to do for me?
If you win?
What should I do for you?
Put it there!
Just put it there!
Put it there!
Let go!
Put it down!
That, I will tell you at the end.
Just promise me, that you will do my request.
I will.
Good.
I have won!
See?
The sign is like that, the sign!
Since your dark pieces won, there would be many people dead somewhere.
What is it this time?
War?
Plague?
People have to die so that in their place more people will be born, right?
What's good if people keep on living?
Over here...you can take them.
This is barley and potatos and corn.
We are giving this for your children that are starving, so you better be very grateful for them.
Thank you.
It's only because this is a big number (of rotten ones),
If you look throughly, there are a lot of things you can eat.
What are you doing and not taking them? !
Yes.
If they were going to just store them and let them rot, couldn't they have given them before these rotted?
Oh, okay.
Becareful not to spill any.
Yes.
You've arrived, my Lord.
For giving us grains like this, thank you very much!
It's such a waste, a waste.
Anyway, they are things you can't eat or sell.
Dispoing the food like this, and making these townspeople into debt will be a great gain for you.
Wait.
Isn't that completely normal?
Ah, yes, that one does seem fine, but even so... it was going to rot.
You, leave that one over here.
There are quite many products for tribute.
Park from Hadong sent 1000 big persimmons,
Choi from Youngkwang sent 240 dried corvinas,
Oh from Wando sent 10 abalones,
Park from Taean sent 30 packs of dried laver, and also from all 8 provinces of the country, many tribute products were sent.
I will manage to sell them back.
Anywho, we should return to Hanyang a day faster if possible.
My Lord!
What is going on?
Ah, yes.
Leebang sent a letter addressed to you.
What did Leebang say in the letter?
The Magistrate... will leave right after the burial.
I guess he couldn't take it anymore.
It's very funny to see him go away like an idiot.
When's full moon again?
Isn't it tomorrow?
What are you going to do?
Tomorrow is the full moon.
The full moon doesn't come frequently in the leap year.
A day that the darkness swallows the full moon....
What did that person say they would do if you couldn't find the girl by tomorrow?
That person couldn't possibly desert you for one mistake.
Don't worry too much about it.
It seems you, Father... should not worry to that extent.
Yes.
You just need to do your job properly. And I just need to do mine.
It's the funeral of the girl you were engaged to. Why don't you try going there.
There will be a lot of spectators.
Who knows...
You might find one or not as if a cow catches a rat while stepping back. (meaning "by chance")
I'll give away that position to you, Father.
She was someone who could have become your Daughter-in-law.
Why don't you give a bowl of alcohol to the coffin bearers?
I think it will benefit you more rather then trying to mimic being generous with rotten grain.
What did you say? !
Aish... that punk!
I can't possibly miss out on my funeral.
Why?
Because I'm going to search for the truth of my death there.
The Magistrate said not to come.
There's no reason for me to obediently listen to his words.
To this degree... he probably won't notice me, right?
I better hurry.
Miss!
Miss!
My goodness!
My goodness!
Is that girl's story really true...?
She can be seen by Dol Soe's eyes too.
That means she is not a ghost.
Did she really become a human?
Oh look at that!
You're thinking about something else, right?
What are you thinking about?
Are you thinking about that woman earlier?
Who exactly is that woman?
How could this happen, Jade Emperor, old man?
Miss!
Miss!
He definitely said he'll leave after having the funeral, right?
Yes, he did.
Now everything is back to normal.
What if he doesn't go?
He has a personality that goes back and forth.
To prepare for such a situation, we should-
Don't talk thoughtlessly!
He will definitely go this time.
He is certainly in that mood.
I didn't ask about where the burial site is.
There's not a single person passing by.
Where are they all crammed in?
I was so surprised.
Thank you.
Are you going to Lee Seo Rim's burial site by any chance?
Can you tell me where it is?
You don't know?
Oh well.
What is this?
What's with the sudden shower of rain?
There it is!
So let me get this straight.
The Jade Emperor sent you back as a human?
So that you can find the truth of your death personally?
So she came back to find out the truth about her death.
Okay then.
Everything worked out well.
You find the truth about your death.
I'll find my Mother who might or not might not be part of the truth of your death.
If that's so I shouldn't be just hanging here.
Hey you!
What?
Why are you playing around?
You should be shoveling.
I am not going to shovel!
You punk!
That little...
Hey!
Who are you screaming at?
Ah, now whom are you ordering to shovel?
You.. you... did you get heatstroke or what?
Isn't that the seamstress granny?
Then she'll probably recognize my face!
What's wrong with his expression?
Did he recognize me?
What is this?
Is he coming in my direction?
You rascal!
Wait... you don't look familiar for some reason.
Hey.
Look at this guy.
Could it be that he's new?
Since we don't have any budget, we fired so many. How can there be a new guy?
Catch that guy, you!
Catch that guy!
Aish.
Where is he going now?
Hey,youpunk!
Catch that policeman!
Catch him!
Stop right there, you punk!
Stop right there!
Catch that punk!
Catch him!
What is with these men?
I knew she would cause trouble!
Aish, they should take it easy!
If they had that kind of muscle (strength) they could've caught plenty of criminals!
What tough jerks!
Catchthatpunk!
Aigoo, aigoo!
Catch him!
Catch him!
Where... where did he go?
Spread out!
You scared me!
Oh?
It's that Young Master!
You...
Please help me out.
Hurry, hurry, hurry!
I will definitely pay the favor back!
A scholar shouldn't carelessly drop to one's knees.
Hey you.
Are you a govnernment person? (working for the govenment, in this case, guard)
Yes.
That's right.
As you can see, I'm a guard.
I'm absolutely a guard.
Hey!
Hey!
We meet again. Arang Episode 5 preview
He really doesn't know.. his own fiancee's face...
Let's work together.
You look for the truth about your death, and I'll look for my mother.
Then now, let's swear as partners.
Why are you doing this?
You said you're a human now.
I have a high expectation for the girl this time..
This is finally the beginning.
Should I save you, My Lord, or Ju Wal?
What should I do?
"Memory loss"!
Episode 8
Young Master, you are coming to your senses?
Yes.
Arang?
What has happened to her?
How is your body feeling?
What has happened to Arang?
She fell from there, so what do you think has happened to her?
I sent patrolmen.
What, you sent patrolmen?
Where do you think you're going in this condition?
Let go of me.
I told you I sent patrolmen!
They will find the body shortly.
Let go.
That wasn't your fault.
I said to let go!
Young Master...
Young Master
YOUNG MASTER!
Kimchee.
When will I be able to free myself from this kimchi? (having to eat kimchi, instead of luxury foods)
Please, Mother, Grandmother!
Ooish... you, pot lid wench!
Am I going crazy?
This darn finger of mine!
I should just cut it off!
What's happening to me?
Are you alright?
I'm fine.
Arang.
Where have you gone?
Are you in your right mind?
Young Master.
Young Master.
What are you doing here by yourself?
She probably drowned or was pulled away by the current.
Let's go back.
I'm about to lose my mind!
What am I suppose to do?
Wait for me.
Your body isn't ready for this.
Seriously please.
I'm fine.
No, you're not.
I said that I'm fine.
Go get some rest.
I'll put the horse away, so go inside and stay put.
Magistrate, you've arrived.
What happened to that?
Did anyone come to claim any?
No, not even one person was identified.
It has nothing to do with this town.
The remains were found on this town, but how could it have nothing to do with this town?
So what I'm trying to say is that the remains could have been here long before this town is made.
Does that make any sense?
Fine.
You can go.
What will you do now Magistrate?
You can start by clearing it up.
Yes.
What a relief.
It seems he's going to let it slide.
I didn't expect no one would come to claim any of them, seriously.
I thought people would come to see even just because of curiousity.
Frankly speaking, who would step forward? They can be harrassed by Lord Choi!
Who would dare to step forward?
Who?
Lord Choi, isn't the type to let things go.
Considering how much he dislikes it when things become noisy.
Do you know what I was concerned the most when Magistrate Kim decided to stay?
It was the town people.
I was worreid if they come to the office often as the new Magistrate is appointed.
That's right. That's it.
Lord Choi really dislikes that.
What!
?
So then not even one person came because they were afraid of Lord Choi?
That's not it.
That's not true.
Why are you out here like this?
Go on inside.
Quickly.
Just leave me alone.
If they find the body, please send her off well with a funeral, just like last time.
This damn town, I found out they are so cold-hearted at that time.
I knew that when no one came for the funeral of the previous Magistrate's daughter.
Do you know why no one came to see those remains?
It was because they didn't want Lord Choi to find out.
They say that Lord Choi hates so much if the town becomes noisy.
Last time when that Lady's remain was found, it was the same reason too.
Although a murderer's tomb was found in their town, there isn't even one single person who wants to know the truth.
Well, if we think in that way, you are also similar to them as you aren't interested in anything about the world, Young Master.
That's true.
The weird one is that punk who even went to the underworld to find the truth about her death.
Pardon?
It's nothing.
You can go.
Yes.
Make sure to go in and rest.
Youcancomebacktolifeifyoudie.
What are you worried about?
Magistrate, you've never died before, so you wouldn't know.
How scary it is at the moment of your death.
What is exactly the truth about your death that makes you endure so much suffering?
What the heck are you so that Madame gave me that kind of order?
What exactly...
It seems the time to test the swords has come.
Save me!
Save me!
Please.
Why are you doing this?
Please spare me!
Since I've already received the payment, I can't do that.
If you feel wronged, die, catch your husband, and ask him.
Here.
Come here.
Come here.
I said come here!
No!
Mom.
Mom.
Mom!
Mom!
Mom!
Mom!
Mom!
Mom!
Mom!
Baby!
What do I do?
What do I do about our baby?
What do I do about our baby?
Our baby!
I can't go, you bastard!
Where are we going? W-What are you doing?
Did Grim Reapers appear?
Bothersome bastards.
How was the sword?
Don't come closer to me!
Go away!
What?
The Reapers!
It has a talisman pattern carved which can destroy souls.
How dare they..
How dare they mess with my Reapers!
Even destorying souls...
The responsible individual must have recovered the power quite well.
That individual must be getting desperate to resort to these kind of deeds.
Yeom Ra has become very angry.
I haven't seen him that angry in quite a long while.
Emperor, do you know who is behind this?
What did you mean when you said that the power is recovered?
Does that mean, that this one had the ability from the beginning?
Does it mean you two already know who the person is?
Who that person is...isn't important.
How we will catch this one... is important.
Why can't we catch the one?
Is it a person?
Is that why we can't catch this one?
Why do you have so many questions today?
It's unlike you.
Then..just tell me this. Does that child, Arang have something to do with this?
- I got it, I got it!
- Hurry, go inside!
Where are you going?
Ah, I'm going to go crazy!
What's going on?
Why are they all gathered in front of the office like that?
Hey!
You there!
What's that? !
Ah, did you guys come her e because of that bone tomb?
Ah, it's not about this..
When will the magistrate come back?
What?
Why?
We.. We have a favor to ask the magistrate about.
A favor? !
What kind of favor? !
Well..
It's..
This.. We have to.. personally..
Look there, you've all got it wrong.
You seem to be unaware but that magistrate isn't the kind of magsitrate you think he is.
This magistrate here doesn't have any interest for his job as a magistrate, not even this much.
I'm not sure, but whatever you folks were imagining about this magistrate, he will be less than that.
That's right.
Our Young Master isn't interested in the world at all to work hard as a proper magistrate.
As I see it, he's staying here only for finding his mother.
As soon as he finds her he'll leave right away.
This brat.
Where the heck did she go? !
Except from here, she really has nowhere to go though..
A place she would know..
Hey there!
Is anybody here?
Young Master!
Young Master where are you?
Where is this?
I need to go to the office quickly.
I should thank the Young Master though..
Hey there!
Is anybody here?
!
How could there be not even one person? !
Hey there!
With such a house how could there be no one?
Then there IS a place I could ask from!
Hey there!
Ghosts!
Ghosts?
Hey, Verandah Ghost!
It's weird...
Doesn't this house have a Verandah Ghost?
Hey there!
Well Ghost!
It's strange..
People seem to be living here though..
Hey, Storage Yard (Ghost)!
Storage Yard!
This can't be..
This house doesn't have any residing ghosts? !
That's odd.
Where is that?
How are you feeling?
Thanks to you, I'm feeling much better.
I feel light as if I can fly.
For three or four months, your disease will not come back.
What worries when you're here, My Lady.
However, it's very bothersome, as it's not fully cured.
Ah.. whatever it is, I'm okay.
It doesn't matter. Well, when I went to meet you for the bone tomb issue, I had that symptom.
Didn't I?
Don't worry.
I've already handled everything neatly.
For handling any kind of thing, there is always the proper timing.
That's why I hurried.
All you need to do is trust me, My Lady.
Anyway, what has happened to the Magistrate?
Why don't you order Ju Wal to get rid of him secretly?
I will clean up the mess after that.
Well, anyway, that brat hasn't done anything properly.
As for the Magistrate, I will get rid of him too.
So, you don't have to worry anything, Madame, and as usual, you can stay here and...
My Lord...
Would you please stop. And close this mouth of yours.
Wicked b*tch...
Should I burn down (the house and her)?
If it weren't for my damn disease, I would've already killed that b*tch and bastard.
Damn it...
Hey there!
Is anybody here?
Is this some talisman?
What's the matter?
How did you get here? !
Who sent you? !
Speak!
Who are you? !
Why aren't you answering?
!
Hey old man!
Ask one question at a time!
You wench!
She is my guest!
She is my guest, father.
Your guest?
Yes.
She came looking for me.
Let her go please.
Guest or not, now that she came here, she can't just go back!
This is not the time to do such things.
In the past, because of your mistake, Father, you know well what happened to your previous wife who came here, and what you paid for that.
Have you already forgotten about that?
I'm sorry.
I was just looking for you, Young Master.
No, my father is unwell now, so he must have been in a bad mood.
I hope he didn't surprise you.
Don't worry.
Thanks to my incredibly strong heart, I'm not easily surprised by any.
That impudent bastard!
But.. how is it that this girl's face looks familiar..
Ju Wal...
you bastard.
Lady.
I was going to let people prepare a palanquin for you.
No, thank you.
There is one person I have to hurry to meet and punish!
Then, don't you at least need a change of clothes?
No, no, no!
These clothes... I'm going to tell that person to pay for these clothes too! .
Then, let's meet again some other time.
I'll definitely return this favor back.
Thereheis ,Ipresume. The only son of this household, Young Master Choi Ju Wal.
Lady...
What is wrong, Lady?
No...
What is your name, Young Master?
Now that you've mentioned it, I realize we still haven't introduced ourselves yet.
I am...
Choi Ju Wal.
And Lady, you are...?
I am...
Arang.
Arang?
It is a good name. Lady Arang.
Lady...
By any chance, have you not seen me before?
Why wouldn't I?
I carried you, and let you rest in my room.
What is wrong?
Didn't we first meet at the former Magistrate's daughter's funeral?
Lee Seo Rim's funeral...
Oh is that so?
Her name is Lee Seo Rim?
Lady...
Foolish girl, just see if you really came here.
I will definitely make you pay the price for making the injured look for you everywhere!
This shouldn't be possible.
How...
How can this be... ?
You covered it up?
These people, seriously!
Damn it!
Did you cover it up cleanly?
Yes.
The townspeople won't talk about that bone tomb any longer.
Anyone who mentions about it will become a fool, whether that's the Magistrate or what-not.
By the way, what is that dubious deserted house?
Just do well on the work that I tell you to do.
Get out.
How was it, Hong Ryeon?
The work should be done like this.
I'mcertain.
Itwasn'tan imagination.
Thattime,my heartwas definitelybeatingsofast.
Whydidhe notrecognizeme?
Why?
Why does he talk about me as if he's talking about a stranger?
Is this the office?
Young Master...
Are you crying?
Young Master, to here...
how did you... ?
I followed you.
I was worried when you left after acting strangely.
You are not well, either.
As you came here, not to the office, I couldn't.. go back.
I don't know what situation you are in, but how about we go back now?
Lady... stop...
I'll go.
UntilI findoutMadame'sintentions, Ican'tgivethatgirl toher.
Are you going to keep following me?
Just.. let me walk with you till the office.
We have almost arrived.
Please let me walk with you till the office.
Like you have your own thought, I also have my own thought.
Why are you smiling?
If you want to go, you will go... if you want to do something, you will do it.
So, are you saying I shouldn't care?
Ah, it's not like that.
Forget it.
I was just reminded of someone who acts the same way.
Do you mean, the Magistrate?
No.
You know the Magistrate?
Ah, you've met him before, on that night.
We have met even before that.
When?
When the body of the deceased Lee Seo Rim was found.
Thinking about it, I have met him first before you.
What is wrong?
Earlier... when was it, you said?
When the corpse of the previous Magistrate's daughter was found.
The Magistrate knew who you are?
That's right.
What are you doing there?
!
You!
When the sun rose, I should have sent her back right away.
There was just a circumstance for a short while.
I am sorry for sending her back late.
Then, Lady, please take care of your body.
When the time is right, I will stop by again.
Good work, all of you.
As the Magistrate went out, it was done easily.
That's no use, though. He will find out anyway.
What excuses are you going to use?
- Let's say it was done by a thief.
- Do you think that makes any sense?
The thief has nothing else to take, so he took that?
Don't worry!
The Magistrate is going crazy as that wench is dead just in time!
Do you think he even has the energy to worry about that?
What was that... that just passed by?
T-t-that... is that a ghost or a person?
Hey!
Stop right there!
Memory Loss!
Well... the reason why I didn't tell you was...
All right!
It was fun!
It was the most interesting thing that ever happened to me since I came to Miryang!
I have never seen such interesting incident ever since I was born!
Why did you do that?
If you gained consciousness, you should have returned right away!
Am I such a pushover?
That man... how and where did you meet?
Until when are you thinking of making a laughing stock out of me?
Where were you all night long?
Were you with that man for the whole night? !
What in the world are they talking about?
I don't know what's going on, but they are talking at cross purposes.
How did that Miss survive?
This is not possible. She is not a person.
Huh?
Do you know how much I looked for you?
!
I thought you couldn't be revived.
What if I couldn't be revived? What?
Do you have any problem with that?
Is there anything you would miss?
Of course you can't say there is none.
Because I have to be here so you can find your mother.
Even you don't say it out loud because you're worried if it will delay finding your mother, isn't it?
A lump of fakeness.
What?
Are you deaf?
Should I say it again?
LUMP! OF!
FAKENESS!
Listen carefully!
For someone as fake as you, I will not regain my memory!
Those bastards...
HEY, THREE BANGS!
Magistrate, w-w-why...
Why did you do that although I didn't order you to do?
Huh?
What...
What do you mean?
Why did you get rid of them without my permission?
Do you all want to die?
Do you really want to know how serious the crime is for the officers to ignore their own Magistrate?
Ma.. Magistrate, we were just...
You're going to pretend you didn't do that?
If it wasn't done by the office, who would dare to touch that crime scene?
What on earth are you planning?
T-t-that... We were just following Lord Choi's order!
Lord Choi?
Are you saying Lord Choi had that bones tomb buried?
Bury the bone tomb?
No, we just followed his order to get rid of the bone remains and stuffs.
What did you just say?
Sirs!
As you ordered, I confirmed that everything was burnt.
What is the meaning of this?
!
We were just following Lord Choi's order.
Lord Choi's order?
Do you think that makes sense right now?
As someone working in this office, do you not know whose orders you have to follow?
!
Well... that's not working in this town.
Haven't you known yet that Lord Choi's words are the law and the rule in this town?
Last time, when the Magistrate Lee's daughter was found, I mentioned that subtly, didn't I?
Honestly, we were jammed between you two, so it's really difficult for us.
To tell you the truth, Lord Choi has been going easy on you all this time.
If you are not only Lord Kim Eung Boo's son, there is no way he will leave you alone...
Let's not make this matter bigger.
It is for the best that we just quietly let this go.
This is what this town is, Magistrate!
Send a message to Lord Choi immediately to make his appearance to the office.
Pardon?
Magis-trate...
And prepare my official uniform.
Pardon?
Iron it straightly!
No matter how much I can pretend not to notice unjust things and just keep going, but I can't just endure this.
How dare them wake up a sleeping tiger?
I will show you all whose words are the rule and the law!
She definitely fell.
But why is she perfectly fine?
She should have some broken body parts somewhere.
Is she not a person?
Is she a gumiho?
(a nine-tailed fox believed to have nine lives)
That's right!
She's not a ghost, but a gumiho!
Thinking about it, her appearance is similar to what people say about a gumiho!
Otherwise, a person like our Young Master wouldn't fall for her.
Whether she's a ghost or a gumiho, he's totally possessed, possessed!
Aigoo, Young Master!
What should I do?
There is no way to find out!
Oh, right, maybe that woman would know.
That.. that woman?
This crazy finger!
Why did you do that?
Why? !
Why?
! WHY!
What do I do...
What do I do...
Do you already know... who that bastard is?
Whothatpersonis... is not important.
That's right.
There is no way Moo Yeon could do this.
She has no reason to do this.
Yeom Ra... is he still being angry?
Do you think he is doing the judgment properly?
Is he taking out his anger on some innocent soul?
No.
That's right.
Our Yeom Ra who sticks with the basic rules...
There is no way that would happen.
Drink.
Try to recognize what taste it is.
It's a tea made with the flowers from the goat's back.
I am not too sure.
What?
Actually, these days, I'm working on a tea which taste will show the person's mind.
If you don't know it, then you don't know your own heart.
It's not like that, right?
Fail!
Aish.. then what should I mix more? Poop?
The goat's poop?
You come only now?
What brought you all the way here...
Do you still not trust me?
What do you mean...
If not, then why are you not showing me that child?
T-t-t... that...
I am sorry.
Since I couldn't fully accomplish your order yet, Madame...
Ju Wal...
Didn't I tell you not to have any doubts?
Is that what is bothering you, why am I interested in that child?
Do you want me to tell you?
I'm not hiding it from you on purpose.
That child... never dies.
Pardon?
She's the immortal being.
The immortal being. Even if she dies, over and over, she won't die.
The one who has a living body and a dead heart.
She is the one whom no one has seen or has had before.
IfonlyIhavethat body ... thenI canliveforever.
Ihave...
to have that child.
To have her, I need your help.
Will you help me?
If only I have that child, you don't have to put blood on your hands every leap month, either.
How good is that?
Then.. then what will happen to me?
What will happen to you?
What are you talking about?
What did I tell you?
That you are my precious possession.
Son, how can a mother throw her son away?
Madame... I...
It's not healing quickly.
If that girl becomes mine, if that happens, can you call me "Mother"?
I...
what do I have to do then?
Do I have to kidnap her and bring her here?
No.
You don't have to do that.
She will walk into here herself. If you just do well.
Then... I...
Didn't I tell you to find out what that girl wants the most?
But... how?
Win her heart.
Make her tell you everything.
Oh, right.
Why don't you become her lover?
You are now a healthy adult man.
Instead, leave your heart behind, here.
My Lord, you don't have to go.
It's not even enough if he comes here and bows to you, but how dare he tells you to come or go?
I will take care of it, My Lord.
No, no, no!
I have to do what that bastard wants.
Why is that?
It's been a while since I've been to the office, and it's not bad to visit there taking this opportunity.
- Let's go.
- Yes.
Here, here!
That's right, that's right!
Good!
As we did this much, I think at least the half of his anger can be resolved.
It will show our sincerity that we're on Lord Choi's side.
What is this crazy earthworm?
Don't mind this. Just go, go.
You, hoodlum bastard!
Young... Young Master!
Isn't that Lord Choi's household's Young Master?
Why did he come here?
That shaman... should come out for work today...
What's with that punk?
Why is there nothing to change into? !
Did you have a good sleep?
Why are you... here?
I told that I would stop by again when the time is right.
This is really... will you keep me standing here?
Then... what do I have to do?
Can you prepare to leave?
What?
Leave?
Why do I have to prepare to leave?
That punk!
Where is he...
It seems you couldn't get the money for your clothes from the person you need to punish.
There is a place I have to go with you.
I tried to deal with it myself, but I couldn't do it by myself.
Help me.
I think you said you would definitely pay back for the favor.
That . .
Okay, fine!
Please wait for a moment.
At least, I need to wash my face.
Goosebumps all over me!
What, dating a ghost?
Above all, in my own office!
And what's with those three again?
!
What are you doing?
!
Aigo, Magistrate, why are you out here?
Until I give you a separate message, please stay inside.
A message my ass!
LordChoihasarrived!
MyLord,thankyou for gracinguswithyourpresence!
Have you been well?
So you are the new Magistrate.
I was pretty busy, so I have been putting off getting a greeting from you.
Since this office building is quite old, there are many parts which need some repair.
If you're uncomfortable to stay here, ask Leebang.
I will tell him to take care of it well.
My office will be taken care of by me, so there is nothing specific for you to care about, My Lord.
All right.
What is the favor that you wanted to see me for?
It wasn't a favor but a summons for your appearance.
Seeyounextweek! Preview
Eolja bastard, moreover, an offspring of a traitor became this town's Magistrate?
I have no intention to respect you as this town's Magistrate, either!
Will you leave them alone like that?
He seems to have a really big concern..
I heard that the flowers at Yeong Rang Roo are really pretty.
Won't you go with me to see them?
Call some guys with good fighting skills.
There is a punk I need to scare a lot.
Justgooverthere.
My Lady.
Don't come towards me!
Episode 17
Young Master.
Arang, back away.
So you've finally come.
I've been waiting so long for you.
Arang!
Jade Emperor's fan is it?
Come out of my mother's body this instant!
What are you planning to do with that?
Didn't you see for yourself that your mother is still in this body?
I saw.
It's because I saw it that I need to resolve this.
Your mother is still in this body!
That's why I'm trying to get my mother's body back!
Dear... dear me.
Did you say your name was Kim Eun Oh?
Kim Eun Oh, You will never get your mother back.
There is one way.
Give your body to me. Then this Magistrate will get his mother back.
What kind of sh*t is this?
The Jade Emperor is done for.
That he could send a little child like you...
Arang!
Arang!
Arang!
You useless punk!
Just hurry back and get her fully recovered.
Arang... are you all right?
Arang, are you all right?
Are you coming to your senses?
Yes.
Good, as for what that woman said earlier, forget it.
You know that makes no sense, don't you?
Magistrate.
Don't say a word and just rest.
Magistrate, you have to listen to me.
I said not to talk.
Earlier, when I saw that woman I remembered something.
The events of that day--I remembered it all.
What?
You remembered?
Then do you know who killed you?
Who was it?
Was it someone we know?
I don't know whether to tell you or not.
What are you talking about?
Arang, who is it?
Who's responsible for doing that to you?
Your....mother.
What?
What did you say?
Your mother...... stabbed me.
What?
What are you saying?
My mother
My mother killed you?
This isn't it.
This can't be possible.
There's no way this is possible.
I had only wished for her not to be dead...
That's why I came this far, looking for her...
What... what is this supposed to mean?
Why on earth?
Why did you allow that monster to reside in your body?
Why on earth...
Mother, what exactly am I supposed to do now?
Please let me live.
Why?
Why are the memories
those erased memories?
Why are they coming back to me?
Young Master.
The Lady is calling for you.
Lee Seo Rim, the truth about your death that you were so earnestly searching for has been revealed.
The one who stabbed me was the Magistrate's mother.
However, she hadn't deliberately tried to kill me.
It's strange.
Could this be all there is to know regarding the true circumstances of my death?
Regarding your questions, you find the answers on your own.
When you've uncovered the truth then I'll ring this bell.
Remember--only the death of the person who led you to your death will ring this bell.
Was it just to find this out that I came this far?
Arang!
I knew you'd be here.
Is your body all right?
Yeah.
Are you all right?
Looking at you like this, it isn't easy.
Should I apologize to you in my mother's stead?
Should I say that I will get vengeance for you and send you to heaven?
Or...
Or ask for forgiveness in place of my mother?
I don't know what I should say to you...
Don't say anything at all.
There's no need.
I've made my decision.
The full moon isn't upon us yet.
There's no way the Jade Emperor would have allowed us to solve this so easily, before the full moon.
Arang ...
There's got to be another truth (more to the truth).
I'm sure there is.
So, don't worry.
Think first about how you can save your mother.
Didn't you say that in your memories, Choi Ju Wal was with my mother?
Yeah.
I need to find out why that guy was with my mother.
What's all this?
He's using private soldiers?
Where did this guy go?
And what are those guys?
Illegal private soldiers and illegal weapons on top of that?
The wily old man...
His scheming is well-planned...
You go that way!
Oh my word!
How could such a thing happen?
She can jump from body to body?
I'm not in a place to speak considering I came back from the dead, but there really are all kinds of strange monsters, aren't there?
So that's why the Magistrate asked about that before.
How did the Magistrate's mother end up in that situation?
No ...
Who exactly is that monster anyway?
I don't know, either.
But you know, she was a really pretty woman.
A woman?
Yeah.
So...isn't there some way to get that girl out of the Magistrate's mother's body?
Aigoo.
I'm not sure...
Then call your ninth-generation ancestor grandmother.
Huh?
!
Uh...how can I call someone who's dead?
It's possible to call them, it's just not easy, is all...
How can you call a dead...
Are you asking me to hold a seance?
That's something even the grand shamans don't find easy.
As you well know, I only have partial psychic talents.
But still, can you try for me, please?
It's fine.
Don't be too scared.
I've been up here multiple times, so I know. Once you get used to it, it will feel as comfortable as your bedroom.
Oh my word...
I think I've been taken in by you again.
Why do I have to go to these extremes?
Hurry up and start.
We need the shirt that the deceased person wore when she was alive.
Hold this in your left hand and put your right hand on your waist.
Then look toward the north.
And say "Miryang, Park MalYun-bok" three times.
"Miryang, Park Mal Yun Bok?"
Yes.
Miryang Park MalYun-bok?
Got it.
Miryang Park Mal Yun-bok!
Miryang Park Mal Yun-bok!
Please!
Please.
Please!
Please ...
Oh! No ...
Don't leave!
Hey!
Grandmother!
Hey, you brat!
Hey, you brat!
Who are you?
Why the h*ll are you calling me?
Great-grandmother? (no specific generation)
That's right.
What did she say?
"That's right, you brat."
Grandmother!
You wench, do you know what you have done?
I did come because you called a seance, but don't do this often. Got that?
It's because it's me that I came so nicely.
Others won't do the same.
What?
What?
Okay, then, why did you call for me?
Is there a way to exorcise another soul from a body?
So you're that wench, Arang.
Rumors about you abound in the other world. They're placing bets.
What?
What?
What is it?
So you would want to go to Heaven?
Heaven?
It's a nice place.
If you go to heaven there's something you need to submit to.
Something that I need to submit to?
You have to leave all of earthly memories behind.
So basically all your current memories will be erased.
Leave my memories?
If something goes wrong, and you end up in hell, the same holds true there.
When you end up at the worst level of hell, as your spirit is destroyed, memories of people cannot survive.
What is she saying?
Aigoo, this useless brat!
Why are you hitting me?
I hit you to improve your hearing.
Why? But still, how could you hit me so hard?
I can hear...
Am I able to hear?
Eh, this little infant...
Okay, so what is it you wanted to ask that you woke me up?
Is there no method for exorcising a soul from another person's body?
It's not precise, but... typically, when the thing that the person considers most precious enters the body, the soul that entered later can be separated.
Right at the moment when that soul is separated, if you stab that later soul with the Jade Emperor's knife, that soul can be destroyed.
but still, it's not anyone who can do the stabbing to make this work.
In any cae, the first thing you need to do is find out what it is that the Magistrate's mother values most.
As for you, take care of yourself. I'm leaving.
Grandmother!
Grandmother!
Grandmother, thank you!
I see that fear has darkened that once bright face of yours.
The memories... why have they come back?
Why do you think it is so?
It's because of you.
If so then..
That's right.
Since I'm unable to feed my spirit, my powers are becoming weaker.
So the revival of your erased memories is really nothing.
Then what do I need to do?
At this rate..
Arang.
Once I posess Arang, all this will come to an end.
Otherwise, nothing you do can help you escape from these circumstances.
Until the day you die, you'll have to carry the memories of those murders, and live as a murderer.
How can this happen...
Why are things like this happening?
Is this.. the punishment for my sins?
I...
What must I do?
Get rid of Kim Eun Oh.
It's because of him that his mother who's in my body keeps trying to get out.
Everytime she makes an attempt I lose so much of my energy.
It's becoming really annoying.
So that guy Kill Kim Eun Oh.
The thing that is most precious to the Magistrate's mother...
The Magistrate probably knows what that is.
What a relief.
This is better than having no method at all.
Arang!
Magistrate!
Magistrate, what's the matter?
I'll call Dol Seo.
No.
It's nothing big.
He'll have a fit if you call him.
But what about this?
Just go into my room and get something to wrap it up with.
Give your body to me.
Then this Magistrate will get his mother back.
What kind of sh*t is this?
The wound is so deep.
What are you doing?
What should I do?
Just wrap it up tightly.
You did it before, didn't you?
What are you thinking about?
That I'm thankful to you.
There are too many things happening all at once.
You, my mother and this place, too.
Only thinking that I was important all my life...
I feel like I'm being punished for that.
How can you say something like that?
Not listening or seeing what others said, that's how I lived my life.
I always thought that each person had to overcome his own pains.
Can someone else do that for you?
But to the person I was back then, why, could I see ghosts that others couldn't see or hear?
I was always angry about that.
But... I changed after I met you.
I was able to understand my mother's pain more clearly.
And then, I was able to see other people's pain too.
Then one day I came to understand
Ah, so that's the way it is.
I am in a position to help those people.
So that's why I'm grateful to you.
No.
It's I,
I haven't done anything for you.
You've done so much for me.
I've never even made you a cup of honey water with my own hands.
The Shaman said, even though you feel like you can't handle the pain of parting ways, but that you'll live on that strength.
Even if you feel like you'll be so bitterly sad to part, but that it's human nature for that sorrow to keep you alive.
That's what becomes love, memories and sentimental longing. That one of those things alone are the strengths that keep you alive.
I by leaving something behind, I thought that would only bring you pain.
Like an idiot.
That's why I pushed your feelings aside and pretended like I didn't know.
I know.
But... those memories can give those left behind strength.
That's what the Shaman said.
I... can't make your body warm.
Or like other people, stay by your side for a long, long time.
Just this, putting on one article of clothing for you.
And, too, as I leave this world I may lose all my memories of you.
But still... I loved you.
Sleep well, Magistrate.
♫ I look for you only... ♫I am looking for the one I long for.
♫The more I look, I want to look for my beautiful beloved whom I'm longing for... ♫ Even yy throat is calling you without restraint...
Even my heart is calling hoarsely... ♫It's only calling your name...
♫I'm picturing you with my tears... ♫You are engraved on my heart... ♫ Even if you are at the end of the world, you are the person who can't be forgotten... ♫Even if I cry a thousand times, The love I long for...
♫ It is you...
Once I possess Arang, everything will come to an end.
That's right.
I will do it according to your will.
And after that... I will do what I want.
I will bring Arang to get rid of my pain and suffering.
And then, I will get rid of you.
Magistrate.
May I come in?
Yeah, sure.
You used to just waltz right in, why ask permission now?
I know, right.
How did it turn out this way?
Last night, there was something I wasn't able to tell you.
I found out a way to get that soul out of your mother's body.
When the thing that the body's owner considers the most precious gets inside the body, the soul that entered later can be separated.
At the moment when that soul is separated, you must stab that soul with Jade Emperor's knife.
Then, the spirit is destroyed.
But it's not just anyone who can successfully wield the knife.
So think carefully, what does your mother consider most dear to her.
And also...
I'm going to meet Young Master Ju Wal.
What?
I'll meet him and ask.
Why he was there that night and what connection he has to your mother.
What happened to your mother.
No, that's my task, so you just stay put.
It's also part of my truth.
Pardon?
What... did you just say?
No... your mother... by a monster was what?
I still don't know for sure what happened.
So keep this to yourself.
Young Master,
Since there was that incident with me, she might have run away.
Initially, we need to capture and imprison her.
I don't really know what is going on, but I'll go and come back.
What's this?
He said she was just here but why isn't anyone here?
What?
It was completely empty?
There wasn't even an ant.
The things you said earlier, was that true?
Although it may be tough, please bear with it for a while.
Fine.
Then I...
It won't take long, right?
Yes.
Lady.
I wanted to meet you so I was waiting in front of your house.
There's something I want to ask.
If it's something about the last time, then I...
No.
I didn't come because of that.
Young Master, just what is it that you are hiding?
What is your connection with that monster?
L...
Lady.
How did that monster get inside the Magistrate's mother's body?
Young Master, you know, don't you?
Young Master.
That person is... a fairy.
Fairy?
That's right.
She has been living in this world, borrowing a human body.
The method of borrowing a person's body... is only possible if the owner of the body allows it.
She grants the body's owner her greatest desire, and receives the owner's body in exchange.
Then... what was it that the Magistrate's mother wanted?
I ... don't know to that extent.
Then, I will meet her and ask her myself.
Lady.
What?
The person who trespassed was the Magistrate?
Yes.
Listening to the description, it seems like it's the Magistrate.
I...
I think I'm going to have to get Geo Deol out.
Although I told him to live a long and lean life, that Magistrate makes me anxious.
Pardon?
What... What would you want to do?
Wake them up. Call all the kids together.
Isn't Lord Choi too late?
Thank you, my Lord.
This will be the last time I'm letting you off.
How can I ever forget your benificence?
For the time being, lay low.
If I need you, I'll call for you.
And watch your behavior.
Yes.
What did you just say?
That Park Geo Deol!
He ran away!
How can a guy in a jail cell get out?
At night, I heard that some guys barged in and got him out
No matter...
Lord Choi is really...
How dare he do that to a prisoner in the government office!
And a murderer at that.
Magistrate, please come out for a while.
What's the matter?
Magistrate, please save my son.
Explain to me what happened slowly.
Lord Choi's soldiers are taking my son away!
Lord Choi's soldiers?
Because I couldn't give Lord Choi's farm rent in time, He took my one and only son to be sold as a slave.
He is being dragged away right now. He is just 8 years old.
What sin did the child commit to be separated from his parents?
Shut up!
They're taking just one boy, but why did they come as a big group?
They are doing that for us to see!
Look at that, shouldn't we be doing something?
If you step forward here and get beaten by them, your whole body would be beaten to pieces, so how would you handle that?
I don't know!
Even if I get emptied of everything, I can't just watch with my two eyes wide open!
Hey you bastards!
What are you doing?
!
Hey, you!
Move!
Magistrate!
Magistrate!
Are you alright?
Aigoo... my child.
Give us that child.
It's Lord Choi's order.
Go and bring the child.
Magistrate, we will never forget this until we die.
We will work hard to repay you.
That's enough, this isn't much.
You can go now.
When our neighbor's child, Sam Wol was sold, I thought it was just some stranger's problem...
I learned that there is no such thing as a "stranger's problem".
Your neighbor's child also suffered the same thing?
It's not just Sam Wol.
In this town, because of the debt with Lord Choi... there isn't just one or two households that are suffering.
Then, we will be going now.
Honestly, saving the child doesn't solve the problem.
Until the debt is paid, they're going to keep getting harassed.
What?
He took the child?
You bastard, I should!
No, wait a minute...
Leebang said that more patrol men were recently hired..
-Kim Seobang!
-Yes, my Lord?
It seems that young bastard is engrossed in playing Magistrate.
Yes, yes...do all you want while you can.
This Magistrate role play will become your karma as it is.
Here, this way.
Make a line, a line.
You can place that here.
Put it down here.
Next!
Over here.
Here, here.
But still...
What should I do, I haven't paid all that debt.
Alright, I get it.
Use up some of your strength!
He looks the same, right?
It's so funny!
Now draw some clothes too!
Hey you brats!
How could you draw...
This won't do.
This is not the time to keep worrying like this.
Now, it's the time for us to make up our minds to choose the line, just like Hyeongbang did.
Geez, how could Hyeongbang choose the line that quickly?
There are so many things to consider.
Lord Choi has his eyes wide open!
Being a simple person can be an advantage in this case.
Is that so?
My head is about to blow.
Old power or new power...?
Who do you think will rise to the top?
You see, this...
I suddenly have this thought.
Are we not missing something here?
That's what I'm saying.
What is it?
It's Miss Arang.
Because of the Magistate and the Lord, we forgot for a moment about Miss Arang.
If we choose the side that Arang chooses,
I have a thought that we will have a smaller chance of failing.
Arang?
Yes.
Lady.
Young Master.
Why are you doing this?
I need to meet that woman and ask her.
Please take me to the place where that woman is.
The reason for you to go this far...
Is it because of the Magistrate?
Then...
I will let you meet her.
It looks like I can't just let you off the hook.
W...
What?
Until now, you had to follow me everywhere like lightning.
You had a hard time, right?
So...
Lets make you into a Chief.
Pardon?
What? !
Patrolmen, listen.
Here, even if Dol Soe is my personal slave, in the meantime he has worked hard in training all of you.
In our government office, to those who does his part to those who have lots of skills and... to those who can be the role models to others, no matter who it is or what position that person is in, I will make sure they take on important tasks within the government office.
Thus. Starting from today, to Dolsoe right here, I appoint him as chief.
Please give him a round of applause.
Chief?
That thing as chief?
Then how do we call him from now on?
Let me see.
Since he doesn't have a last name, do we have to call him Chief Dol?
Bang Ul Ri.
Oh my.
What is it?
How do I look?
It suits me, right?
Young Master told me to wear it from today onwards.
Though I'm not sure if it's alright for him to do this.
Form now on, don't call me Dol Soe.
Call me Chief.
It's sad because I don't have a last name but...call me Chief Dol.
It's Dol SOe cause it's Dol Soe.
But what is Chief Dol?
Why are you like this?
I just like Dol Soe.
This kind of Dol Soe is just so-so.
Hey there, Bang Ul Ri.
What are you doing?
That's what I'm saying.
Why are you like this today?
Are you pouncing on me?
What?
What a nonsense!
What are those?
If I want to take out Moo Yeon from Hong Ryeon's body, I can't do it with only my strength.
Kim Eun Oh... I would need his help.
You can go down now.
As of today, your detention is lifted.
Hey there, what's wrong?
There are so many ghosts around us!
What?
Look, here is now so peaceful...
Chief Dol!
Chief Dol!
Could it be...
The one that Arang Agassi... the Grim Reaper?
Bang Wool was saying about seeing ghosts and such...
Then something suddenly hit me at the back. I fainted right away.
Aigoo...
Dol Soe, go and get some rest.
I'll do so.
What's the matter?
There's a way to save your mother.
What do you mean?
There's a way to save your mother.
What do you mean?
Kim Eun Oh, the child that is inside your mother... she's my sister.
Her name is Moo Yeon.
What?
You can't force her out of your mother's body.
She should come out on her own will.
What's that way?
You will know.
What?
Give Arang's body?
I can't allow that.
I thought your goal... was to save your mother.
We will need to join our strengths together, Kim Eun Oh.
That way you would be able to save your mother,
And I would be able to save my sister.
Don't say things that make me laugh.
Don't say nonsense such as there's no other way than using Arang.
Find a real way. Then I will be your ally a thousand, even ten thousand times.
Even when I was stuck on the floor in the dark inside of me, there was love.
I was once a human...
That love I always laughed at... also once dominated me...
When we were lovers, we longed for each other crazily, but... we couldn't have happiness.
Because our fates were so deep, we reincarnated as siblings.
Time changed and even as our names changed,
Ilovedmy Brother.
Even as we met as a Grim Reaper and Heaven's Fairy, I loved him just like before.
I didn't like living in Heaven.
Since I can't have love in Heaven
I told him to return back as humans because I found out the way to go back, but you refused.
That's why if you're in the dark for a long time, you forget what you were looking at in the beginning, and when everything became dark, it's not love nor obsession nor desire, it just became the evil monster itself.
That's why humans are weak in several aspects.
This is the place.
Thank you.
Even if I told the Lady to do according to what she wants...
I will go in now.
Don't listen to anything that woman says.
What...is this sound?
Criminal, Kim Eun Oh, come out now and receive this order.
What?
What's wrong?
Drag him out!
Yes!
Welcome.
What's wrong?
Why?
Let me go!
What's this?
You bastards!
Let me go!
Arang and the Magistrate Preview
You arrogant bastard.
You won't be able to do anything.
Just like your foolish mother couldn't.
Lord Choi!
Young Master, why on earth are you with that woman?
Daring b**ch.
She is harder to get than I expected.
Help me, Brother.
Help me.
She's here.
What did the Magistrate's mother want in return for her body?
What would you want so that you would give your body?
To protect the people precious to you?

- [snoring] - Po.
Po! - Huh?
Oh, sorry, master shifu.
It's just so comfy up here.
[groans] - All right, back to training.
- Whoa!
[all grunting] Master shifu, we spend hours every day Training our--[grunts] off.
And why?
- Because you are all that stands Between the innocent and evil.
- But we kick evil's-- [groans].
Good one.
Seriously, our kung fu skills are way past overkill.
- He's got a point.
- [grunts] No, we can't slack off on training.
You never know when some giant fiendish beast Will strike at us with its horrible fanged tentacles.
- Have another bad dream?
[groans] - none of your business.
- Ow.
- True warriors must always be at their peak.
- But, dude!
I mean, "master dude."
No one we ever fight is even a challenge anymore.
We can beat all the bad guys with just our pinky fingers.
- That, po, is a woeful exaggeration.
- There's trouble in the village!
- This is why you have to keep your kung fu in top shape.
Who knows how serious this could--
- It's the croc bandits!
- And never mind.
- Puny shopkeeper, tremble in fear As we forcibly redistribute your wealth in our direction.
- Eh, no.
- No?
- No.
Can I interest you in some bitter melons?
Two yuan a dozen.
- Ooh.
[smacks] - I don't think you understand how this works, guy.
We're bandits and we're robbing you.
- I understand how it would work If you were real bandits, But you're a joke.
So how it actually works is... Buy something or get out!
- Darn it!
Are we crocodiles or are we-- What are those things that are like crocodiles But smaller?
- Uh, dwarf crocodiles? - [smacks lips]
- Just attack that guy!
- [clears throat] - Gah...
- Okay, here's where I prove my point.
- [sighs] - Furious five, pinkies out.
- Oh, this is just dumb.
- And I don't have pinkies.
- Me neither.
- Oh, forget it.
By myself, pinkies only. And go!
- [sighs] - Showboat.
- [groans] - Eh?
[punches landing, groaning] - This is all just so sad.
- Huh?
Eh?
So have I made my point, Or do I have to beat them again with just one pinky?
- Hey, wait.
Aren't you gonna--
Wow, they didn't even bother to arrest us.
- This is all just so sad.
Here.
Here's a few yuan to tide you over.
- Master shifu.
How awesome was I in there, huh?
If anything, I may have been a bit too awesome.
But honestly, sometimes I just can't control How awesome I be, so--
- Do you think you don't need to train so much?
Do you?
[sighs]
Fine. As of now, po is in charge of training.
- No way.
- Yay.
- Good luck with that.
- We are not going to seriously go through with this, are we?
- Come on, it'll be fun.
- [giggles] - That's exactly what I'm afraid of.
- Well, we just made more in pity money Than we made in the last three months of banditry.
Do you know what that means?
That means we are officially beggars.
There's gotta be someone we can rob. [footsteps]
Mah-jongg.
Ha ha! All right, old guy, Hand over your money and you won't get hurt.
- Or you could hand over your money And ywon't get hurt.
[laughter] - Are you, like, trick or treating, guy?
You're smaller than my head.
[laughter] - [mocking gibberish] - Then I guess you have nothing to fear, hm?
- [groans] - Thank you.
We'll consider this payment for your training.
- Training?
- Do you enjoy being beaten by po and the furious five Again, and again, and again, and again, and again, And again, and again?
- No, sir.
It stinks, sir.
- Then your training begins now.
- [groans] - That was lesson one.
I am master jia, And you are going to hate training with me.
- You are going to love training with me.
Ta-da!
- I am not doing this.
- Shifu said I'm in charge, ♪ so you gotta do what I say ♪ [swing creaking]
- Yes!
All right, it's time to try out Our new kung fu skills.
Now I don't want you guys getting cocky, all right?
We'll rob someone easy.
- [whimpers] - Oh, no, you didn't.
- You got a problem?
- I don't have a problem.
I am a problem.
Your problem, that you have.
- I heard of you guys.
They say you're total wimps.
- That's what they say?
- Croc bandits, take care of these lowlifes.
- Let's get out of here.
- [whimpering] - Go home to your mama And tell her your kung fu is subpar.
[whimpers] - [laughs] Okay, guy, hand over all your--
- Thanks for saving me from those bandits.
Here's your reward.
[cheers and applause]
- That was awesome!
- Oh.
You know, I could get used to this.
[cheers and applause] - They saved us!
Oh, yes!
- All right, one side, make way.
You guys again?
Fine, my pinkies could use a workout.
- But the crocs weren't--
- Don't trouble yourself, sir.
We'll handle this.
What the hey?
Yah. Ow.
Ow!
Whoa, it looks like you've been training.
- Looks like you haven't.
- We've been training.
- How is a pie-eating contest training?
- Because it-- be--rah--
We challenge you to a pie-eating... Contest.
No?
Ooh! - Stop.
These crocs are heroes, And you come along and start beating on them?
- Sh-yeah, beating' on our fists with their faces.
- You call yourselves masters. - Yeah!
[crowd jeering]
- Uh, well, a honest mistake. [chuckles]
Right, so we'll just be heading out then.
- I think that would be best, guy.
- Here.
[laughter and cheering] - So how do you like being a hero, fung?
- I like it a lot, gah-ri.
I like it a lot.
[groaning] - So things went weird with, you know, bandit-ing. But it was actually kinda cool.
[groans] It's like we were the good guys.
- Perhaps you have at last Discovered your true destiny.
- Nah, but we finally found out What we're really supposed to be doing.
- The point is:
Maybe there's more Than one way to defeat the furious five.
- Like, beat them--like, be better good guys than them?
Oh!
Oh, that would be so boss.
- Take this.
The next time you see the one they call "shifu,"
Present it to him.
[groaning] - Help!
Help!
- [groans] - Huh?
I don't understand it.
Those guys get everywhere before us.
And all of a sudden, they're, like, good and junk.
I mean, they're good guys, And they're also, like, good at kung fu.
- Is that so?
Tell me, how is your training going?
- Uh, monkey ate six pies?
- Uh-huh.
Obviously, the crocs have been training.
There's only one master who could teach them
So much so quickly: Master jia.
He is one of the great kung fu masters of china.
But greater even than his fighting skill Is his belief in the power of training.
He travels the land, accepting only those pupils Who are willing to commit themselves fully To his training regimen.
[bowl shatters] The reward for their hard work: Those who train with master jia
- So you think the crocs Have been training with this master jia?
- I would stake my reputation on it.
- And you're saying that the way to be better than the crocs
Is to train really, really hard? - Exactly.
- I--yea--nahhh.
- [sighs] - Noodles, soup, dumplings.
- We're here for the money, old man.
- Oh, really?
Loyal customers? - Not so fast.
- Fung?
- Oh, hey, lumpy.
- So is it true you're, like, a good guy now?
- Yeah. [chuckles]
It's a funny old world.
[bird chirps] Oh, okay.
So now's, like, when we fight.
- [sighs] uh... [groaning] [pants nervously]
[both pant nervously]
- [screams] [both scream] [both pant nervously] - It's you guys!
- I was full-on gonna say the exact same thing.
- What are you guys doing here?
- Um, saving your dad's noodle shop.
What are you doing here?
- That too!
- Well, we already saved it, so tough turkey.
- You can't-- look, look.
We're the heroes around here.
- Are not.
- Are too.
- Are not.
- Are too!
- Hey, while you heroes were arguing, Those guys robbed me.
- You let them get away.
- We totally had it handled before you got here, pal.
- It's true, son.
You did ruin everything.
- Thanks, dad.
Thanks for that.
- Look at them.
The furious five are old and played out.
- You say that after all we've done for this village?
- You named a well after me.
[droplet drips] - Look, you guys were great, But maybe it's time to make way for someone
Who can still do the job. - Ridiculous.
Maybe the furious five aren't quite at their peak,
But that's no reason to-- - oh, there you are.
Like, I'm supposed to give this to you.
- Oh, no.
- What is it?
- It's a letter from the emperor himself.
He sent jia to train your replacements.
- Wait, what?
- The crocs are the new furious five.
My friends, we have been fired.
- [gasps] no!
- Whoo-hoo!
Oh, I'm sorry.
That was insensitive.
[whispering] whoo-hoo.
- We're fired?
- So we can, like, move into the jade palace?
- That can't be right.
- The jade palace is our home.
- Not anymore.
Now it's the crocs' home.
- But they can't--
- This is the emperor's official seal.
To disobey would be treason.
- On the plus side, we've totally been living In the bamboo forest, so at least It's a step up for someone, right?
[laughs] right?
Okay, we'll have your stuff boxed up and sent to you.
Ciao! Mwah.
- Whoo-hoo!
- It has been an honor to work with you, But nothing lasts forever.
Good-bye.
- This is...
- All my fault.
- All your-- well, now it's no fun.
- I know it's my fault.
But maybe it's not too late to fix it.
- Of course it's too late.
That scroll says the crocs are the new furious five!
- Hold on.
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, Hold on, hold on!
- Holding.
- It says master jia is commanded To train the replacements for the furious five.
He trained the crocs, but that doesn't mean He can't train the replacements for them too!
Master jia?
Hello?
Olly olly oxen free!
Jia, jia, jia, jia, jia!
[groans] That's it, I give up.
We're never gonna...
What?
Aah! Wow, you're really small.
Master jia, I presume? - Yes.
And you must be the one they call "po."
[groans] - Lesson one: Never drop your guard.
- So you'll train us?
- If I do, this will be the most intense, arduous, And painful training you have ever experienced.
- Boo-ya!
- Oh.
I, uh--I didn't realize.
That sounds kind of, uh... [sighs] we're in.
- Hah! Ow...
- Aw, this is the life, huh?
Food, shelter, lots of ancient weapons, Custom tile and junk.
- There's trouble in the village!
- [groans] what is it now?
- Bandits are robbing ying the grocer.
- Ah.
Hm, hm, hm. Well, according to my records, Ying failed to make his protection payment this week,
So the dude is up a xiaoxi without a duanjiang. - The old furious five never charged people, you know?
- Yeah, faulty business model.
[all grunting] - You have trained well, my pupils.
- Even me?
- Yes, po.
Although perhaps with a little more crying than the others.
- Dad says that's my special gift.
- Come with me.
- Where are we going, master jia?
- If you want the jade palace back, You'll have to prove you're more worthy of it Than the crocs are.
- They're back.
They're back!
Where have you been?
- The crocs charge money to protect us!
- They take our goods whenever they feel like it.
- They eat raw onions.
- So you're saying you miss us?
- Yes, we do.
[overlapping agreements]
- Well, if it isn't the spurious five.
That means "fake." - fung.
They are here to challenge you for the jade palace.
- So be it.
I can't help but notice you guys have been training.
- Thanks.
- [groans] - And I can't help but notice That you guys haven't.
- Well, we've been busy with all the graft And corruption, and the like.
- Ah... - You have to make time for training, fung.
True warriors must always be at their peak.
- But it's so--[groans] hard.
- [grunting] training may be hard, But it's not as hard as this!
- [groans] - See, guys, I used to think training Was something you did until your kung fu was good enough.
Now, I see that kung fu is training.
It's something you have to live every day.
- Well said, panda.
Well said.
- Thank you very-- wait, what?
- Shifu?
- Really?
- No way.
- Should've seen that coming.
- [gasps] - I feel used, guy.
- Po, I had to go to some extremes, But I think I may have finally gotten you To understand the true importance of training.
- You sure have, master shifu. [chuckles]
- Good, so-- - that's why I'm glad
We just did a whole bunch of it So we can take a break for a while.
Whoo!
Who wants a nap?
- Me!
- I'll take two!

You will be spending the night here.
I cannot have you disappearing on me this evening.
wouldn't you like to?
You could stay the night as well.
that'd be nice.
I'd love that a lot. No.
I'll return with Kōetsu-dono as well.

Stay here and have a nice rest. It's fine if you take hold of this good opportunity and then come back tomorrow.
Dayū here has gone to the trouble of showing her concern for you as well.
Concern?
Yoshino Dayū. Has something happened? Yes.
Musashi-sama...? What is it?
Even a woman like me who is unfamiliar with the arts of war can tell from your conduct and expression that you appear to be a man who could be slashed to death at any moment.
What?
My conduct...
wish to try and become a human being similar to this biwa.
It has only these four strings and a board for its trunk....
And yet a rich variety of sounds can come out of it... isn't it? concerning those mysterious tonal colors...
Take a look.
isn't it? I think all those variations in sound...
It is this crosspiece that acts as both the bones supporting the body of the biwa as well as its heart.
if this crosspiece was merely straight and stiff and everything was tight and tense you wouldn't get much sound from it. You could say that where the biwa's tonal richness is born from is in the power of both ends of this crosspiece and its ability to move around with a moderate amount of slack. I believe the mental readiness with which we humans should live should be similar to that of this biwa.
You are strong.
Far too strong.
you should become much weaker.
What are you doing...
Let's go!
Yes! wait!
What is it? !
What is your intention in making me wait?
I don't think it's necessary to answer that here.
are you well prepared? Prepared?
A samurai's preparations go on even while they are sleeping. Come at me at any time. before that!
Do the Yoshiokas wish to assassinate me?
Have you come with a grudge?
Have you come to get revenge for the match I had?
Tell me which it is! I'll tell you so that you'll know.
Denshichirō how could we of the Yoshioka clan allow you to go on living? !
but we must take your neck for that.
I will be your opponent as long as my entire body and two swords can go on.
one thing!
What we'll be doing here is different than just using bokken. often used during practice matches Itakura will come!
If a government official like Itakura were to come here and get involved you can expect he won't treat this as a mere quarrel case.
each and every one of you would become a disgrace to all those who call themselves samurai.
And as for the justification the Yashioka's teachers and students are using here wouldn't that rather make you the laughingstock of the world? What? !
according to the customs of the sword be done at some chosen time and place?
Indeed. It truly mustn't be done in the streets.
who are you?
590)}Sasaki Kojirō 680)}I am Ganryū. Who was Sasaki Kojirō. Sasaki Kojirō!
Sasaki Kojirō-dono would you guarantee that Musashi here won't run away until the chosen day without fail?
I could do that...
How about it?
I agree.
So he says.
tomorrow morning during the final third of the Hour of the Tiger. so about 4:30am at Sagarimatsu. That Sagarimatsu will be the meeting place.
Seijūrō and Denshichirō's uncle whose name is Genjirō.
While Genjirō is the heir to the Yoshioka clan... he will be present and attended by many assistants.
tomorrow morning during the final third of the Hour of the Tiger. Sasaki Kojirō.
Why are you watching out for me?
The principal occupation of the Hon'ami clan is to appraise and to sharpen swords.
Although that skill in sharpening swords has come down to us from the first world of the Ashikaga's...
Toyotomi generations this may be the first time it could be said Kōetsu himself has sharpened a sword.
I'm much obliged. what is it you like about swords?
Huh? for what reason do you walk along the path of the sword?
That's to make my name by the sword.
Is that right.
I hope you can find a true meaning for it someday.
True meaning?
Musashi...
Otsū-san! You should still be sleeping...
Where is Musashi-sama?
Musashi-sama hasn't gone...?
Otsū-san... Are... you an acquaintance of Musashi-dono's?
he has gone?
a little while ago.
Musashi-sama is... He's the one I've been searching so long for. Oh!
Where is Musashi-sama? Where did he go to just now?
Just now he went on towards the remains of the Ichijōji Temple over yonder.
Ichijōji Temple...? Will he be returning here?
Otsū-san!
okay?
The road is divided into three parts.
Let's think about which one Musashi will come out of.
and Genzaemon-dono.
590)}Mibu Genjirō 596)}Mibu Genzaemon approximately ten of our senior people will stay with them.
The rest of you divide yourselves up among the three roads and hide somewhere along the way.
Got that?
Yes sir!
the Yoshiokas have 76 men with them.
76?
but that's an incredible number of them.
It's every bit like a war battle. What will you do? Will you run away?
No way. I want to leave my name in history as the man who defeated the world's best; the Yoshioka family.
And...
I am going to become this world's unparalleled and peerless swordsman. Sounds interesting.
Musashi-dono. ...will you have a match with me?
I haven't been defeated.
it would turn out to be a good match. you're saying you want to lose?
But by defeating Miyamoto Musashi I would be the peerless one.
Musashi-sama... what on earth are you doing here? I heard you'd been hurt... Not in the least.
When I thought of Musashi-sama heading into a duel from here I completely forgot anything about my own body.
Otsū... Musashi-sama... aren't you?
If Musashi-sama is willing to die then I have no intention of living either.
I can forget this weak body of mine.
I can say this without shaming my reputation.
Otsū.
Otsū. I have neither home nor family; I'm just a penniless rōnin.
if I can gain fame with the sword the road to being a government official might open up for me. At that time...
Otsū.
But if you died such a day would never come!
I don't need you to have a successful career!
I only want to be together with Musashi-sama!
Please don't go! Please! Let's you and I run away together!
I'd be the world's laughingstock. Wherever I'd run away to the Yoshioka's would forever be chasing me down to murder me. This is an all-or-nothing battle.
I lose everything. But Otsū... I will win.
Not only for my own sake but for your sake as well.
I'd hate it...
I'd hate it if Musashi-sama lost... Please! Don't go!
If I do win this fight I will definitely come and get you.
let me go now.
Musashi-sama...
Musashi-sama! Otsū! Musashi-sama...!
Will I get a look at his skills?
I'm going to win and become peerless!
That's one.
five and six.
nine... withdraw!
You... Father!
The flame of the Yoshiokas will definitely not be extinguished!
Doing things on sly until now...
is that what tied your lives together?
This is also the art of war. For the sake of winning.
Come.
I won...
I think that's leaves a good feeling.
hearing about the Yoshiokas I can see they were too fragile.
It wasn't that the Yoshiokas were weak.
It's that man Musashi who is tremendously strong.
604)}Hon'iden Matahachi 688)}What's that about Musashi?
become successful men. say...
I wonder who'd win?
Ah...
I think it'd be Sasaki Kojirō.
Musashi's sword is crude while Kojirō's sword is refined...
Kojirō'd come out on top.
huh?
Brother.
What is it? Got a minute?

Hiei is holy ground and must not permit itself to become a haven for those involved with outlawry.
You shall immediately withdraw from this temple.
If you are in violation of this law then according to the strict rules of this temple you will be punished resolutely.
All right. I'll leave. what do you mean by "outlawry"?
I'll tell you.
You cut down Yoshioka Seijūrō and Denshichirō... you also cut down Mibu Genjirō.
your duel with the Yoshiokas should have been finished. why did you go on and murder all seventy of their remaining students?
Such useless killings!
that was a cold-blooded act! I'd be the one who was dead.
now couldn't you?
and that was because in your heart you enjoyed murdering them! You're wrong! what was it?
Was it for some great achievement? Did you want to become famous as the man who managed to wipe out the entire Yoshioka clan?
You won't deny it?
How shameful!
you consider yourself a human being?
In order for a rōnin such as me to gain fame I had no choice but to do that!
I pity you. The times have changed. A sword that does not kill people...
That is the sword of Yagyū Sekishūsai.
You are a pathetic man who has been left behind by the times! The light has already turned poor for today. It will be fine for you to leave at first light tomorrow.
Yes? I have a favor to ask.
I will... have my revenge!
Ow... Ow... Obaba?
In response to the mercy you've given me... hurts...
Let's rest.
Here.
let's go see Matahachi.
What are you saying?
He ain't dead! Matahachi is living happily.
Matahachi wasn't at Mt.
Fuwa.
you're nothing but a sham of a good person.
Such useless things... I don't want to hear them!
wait here a little while.
A note from Musashi-sama.
Though he was at Mt. Hiei's Mudōjōi Temple...
He's set off on a journey. Eh?
60)}I'll be waiting at the inn in Seta 158)}Miyamoto Musashi 226)\frx358\fry8}Sake Meals
Do you serve food here? Yes. Come in.
Matahachi?
Takezō!
Since Sekigahara!
We haven't met since then. that's right.
She was heading towards Kyoto.
You should go and surprise her.
She's totally convinced you died at Sekigahara.
let's have a drink for now.
Give us a bottle. Those injuries; they must be from Sagarimatsu?
You know about that? The whole world's in an uproar over it! 178)}Sake Meals
I see... 474)}Rest Stop
I'm totally useless... my first major step went wrong.
What about you two?
That's right.
I wonder what Otsū is doing right now?
Did Otsū forgive me for abandoning her like that?
Right now Otsū is being looked after at Hon'nami Kōetsu-dono's mansion in Kyoto.
huh?
I've made a promise to meet Otsū in Seta. You made a promise to meet her?
Are you... seeing each other?
will you come with me?
Matahachi.
Edo?
I have this great money-making idea.
I intend to follow the way of the sword just as I have been.
Then I'll take all the profit for myself.
What'll you do about Obaba? Ma...
I should chase after her right away.
Musashi.
Let's meet again. Yeah.
It's me.
you've become beautiful.
What are you thinking about right now?
Nothing... at all.
Haven't you been thinking about me?
there hasn't been a single day when I didn't remember you. What are you talking about?
The one who chose another woman and abandoned me was you!
Talking about things from so long ago is painful.
I was totally in the wrong. I can't give you up.
Those days will never return...
We can no longer call back what our old feelings once were.
Otsū. Otsū!
No... It cannot be done! Otsū!
Are you thinking about Musashi?
I love him dearly.
I've made up my mind that I will be married to him for all of my life... Otsū!
All right.
It was under Musashi's orders that you met with him.
that's how it was.
I made a decision about my own life and it was not upon Musashi-sama's orders.
a man can be obstinate.
If that's your decision... What are you doing?
too! I can't let you and Musashi get married in my lifetime!
I won't permit it!
WHO would permit it? !
Ah!
If you consider your life to be precious then swear here that you won't think about Musashi!
swear! 586.5)}Seta
Would you happen to be Miyamoto-dono?
That's right... Oh...! Lord of Aoba Castle over in Ōshū..
588.5)}Ishimoda Geki 690)}...and my name is Ishimoda Geki. Oh...
I had a feeling from the start that my journey this time around would be auspicious somewhere along the way.
Ah... now. let's get acquainted. Geki-dono.
What on earth is this about?
Why would you do all this for a person such as myself?
I see...
You are quite right to be suspicious. there's no particular meaning behind it... But if you forced the question onto me... in a word...
I have watched and longed for you ever since. would you like to come under our employ?
Of course I would. well then...
Musashi-dono?
Would you come with me to Sendai? it's as good as a done deal.
To tell the truth...
If my wish were to come true like this...
I have been working hard at my pursuit of knowledge in the ways of the sword.
Truly... I am truly indebted to you. no...
To have you this pleased at accepting it.. Musashi-dono. I am extremely pleased as well.
Ah... Musashi-dono... Yes?
you were surely with the Western Army?
Is there something about it? If you were... Yes.
I was formerly a common foot soldier under Ukita Hideie-sama.
What's that?
! How could...
This conversation did not take place.
Shogun Ieyasu has written a list of restrictions to all daimyo everywhere.
Within those there is a line in which none of them is to employ rebels.
Rebels? Rebels! Those who took part along with the Western Army at Sekigahara!
That means...
It means there is no Lord anywhere who would be able to employ you.
Not for as long as the world of the Tokugawa continues!
You... are a mere murderer!
A murderer... you cut down Yoshioka Seijūrō and Denshichirō... you also cut down Mibu Genjirō. your duel with the Yoshiokas should have been finished. why did you have to go on and murder all seventy of their remaining students?
Was it for some great achievement?
You are a pathetic man.
now couldn't you?
How shameful!
Do you still feel like saying things about gaining fame like some heretical devil?
Ahh! But you didn't run away and that was because in your heart you enjoyed murdering them!
I will definitely come back a success from Sekigahara. I promise!
Damn it!
Matahachi! Did a fish get away from you?
Taizō-sama.
What are you doing in a place like this?
right?
Where is the man named Miyamoto Musashi?
he set off on his journey this morning.
This morning? Yes. Do you happen to know where he was going?
Dunno...
You will become a well-digging laborer and enter Edo Castle through the western citadel at Marugoshij Castle. with a pistol.
for the pistol you'll use I will bury that with my own hands beneath the camellia tree inside the castle. you'll be okay.
because the workers are sent home once it grows dark you'll have to come up with some scheme to get it yourself. Got that? Taizō-sama.
I'd like to build up my war chest a little.
that city became the center of Japan... 597.167)}Edo ...and the entire city was full of life under what was called a "rush of construction.
I wonder why they're building so many houses?
What are you doing?
That hit the bullseye!
What are you laughing at!
Apologize! Apologize!
This is all because of Akuzō.
Why did you die and leave your Mother like this... isn't it?
Umm! Obaba. Are you still trying to track down Musashi?
Of course I am!
so I thought I'd try tracking him down in Edo.
Which inn are you staying at right now? I haven't picked one out yet.
would you come to my place?
The room rate would be free.
I'm under your care. Sure.
Priest Takuan...
I wonder how he was able to get an inn like this?
was living under a code of clearing and cultivating land.
Do you intend to make a field out of this?
named Iori?
And the other one's just a beggar who's settled here.
588.5)}Iori what should I do with this?
Put it over there.
Hosokawa Tadatoshi of the Hosokawa family... 586.5)}Hosokawa Tadatoshi 126)}...was living in the daimyo's residence his family maintained in Edo. 598.5)}Iwama Kakubei
There's something strange about you.
This'll be the first time you'll serve as a samurai?
He has no knowledge about entering the services of a daimyo.
I've heard from Kakubei about your wish to join our clan.
Why did you come to wish to join our clan?
As my place of death I had the sensation this clan would be a good one to die for...
Hmm...
What's you style of martial arts?
Did I overdo it a little?
The Lord was deeply impressed as well.
he'll employ you as a fencing instructor.
about your search for Miyamoto Musashi...
Have you found out anything?
I haven't gotten any news about him since Sagarimatsu.
After what happened there... The rumors going around now are that he's thrown away his swords.
Why are you so concerned about Musashi? This may sound arrogant... I don't enjoy it.
The sword I loved so much ever since I was a child; I no longer enjoy it now. Knowing I'll win against someone of a lower level and will murder them brings me pain.
if Musashi and I were to fight I feel I would regain the pure joy I had in my childhood. Oi! Don't go making this nothin' but a boring puddle of yer own crap!
ya kin eat all the buds ya want... while yer bellies play toots with yer farts!
A great many people are saying such things. Out of the way.
aren't you?
So why don't you carry a sword? will you go off on another journey sometime just like what you were on when you came here that time?
I was happy.
Thank you for making my Father's grave.
586.5)}Koyanagisei Castle
I'm obliged.
Kimura-sama will be coming shortly.
Ah. Traveler. Yes?
If I may ask you an abrupt question would you happen to know of a man called Miyamoto Musashi?
right?
Would you happen to know where he is right now? no...
I've heard nothing but rumors about him.
Is that right...
Thank you for waiting. Ah... Sensei!
You have a guest.
I've been looking for you for a long time.
Do you remember our promise from that time?
I would be the peerless one.
I'll accept that challenge. I remember.
I want you for my opponent as soon as possible.
I threw away my swords.
Because of... Sagarimatsu?
That's right.
And so you came to be carving images of the Buddha?
Is it to comfort the souls of those who died?
I don't know.
Sensei!
What is it?
Please come right away. Where to? The village.
People from the mountains are headed there.
The guys who struck at us three years ago...
Mountain people...?
Bandits?
That bell is to inform about them?
Hurry and go.
Please help the villagers!
Sensei!
Sensei!
I'll go.
Sensei!
Guide me there.
Sensei!
Take the women alive!
You come with me!
Incredible... Oi! Kill him!
You der!
We come fer the bastard dat's been gettin' in our way. Oh! It's that guy...
Throw away yer sword!
Or I'll kill this fellow!
Kodake!
Ma!
Hurry and throw it away!
I'll really kill dis fellow!
One...
Two...
Three!
bastard.
Kodake!
I'll gives 'em dat long sword!
Do you feel lost using someone else's sword?
What? Miyamoto Musashi has come back.
I will be returning to the Buzen Kokura fief from here.
Um...
We made you some rice balls.
Please eat them!
Come... Thank you.
I'll take them. Let's go! Heave-ho!
for what reason do you walk along the path of the sword? I hope you can find a true meaning for it someday. Heave-ho!
two...
Iori. Yes. Heave-ho!
Heave ho! It moved! It moved!
Iori.
I think I'm going to leave here.
Yes.
Sensei.
580.5)}Edo Castle
jerk?
ya bastard!
Ah... Oi!
wait! You bastard! Whaa!
End of work!
End of work!
End your work! Finish up! Have you reflected on your actions a little?
Got it!
A rock!
not here...
It's not here!
Is this it?
Takuan!
Not coming?
I said to come... This...
This hole is just...
Give that up. It's just a waste of time.
All the good and evil deeds alike that humans draw while above ground will... never disappear throughout their lives. What you are doing now to the soil to try and make it disappear right away...
That's just the sort of thinking that led you into such a rough life... you big sinner.
come!
I will behead you and kick you into the pool of blood!
Ow! Ow! That hurts!
You'll tear off my ear! You'll tear off my ear!
It's been a long time.
Delicious. Musashi... haven't you?
Yes.
became troubled in his later years by the contradiction between the Buddist doctrine of making use of life and the martial arts doctrine of killing life and so he bid his disciples to discard their spears and forbade them from practicing in the martial arts.
Yeah. Then I earnestly begged him to allow me continue teaching the spear at Hōzōin.
How were you able to overcome that contradiction?
Overcome it?
wasn't able to overcome it... now would I? Fool.
The contradiction still remains a contradiction... right here.
people want to make everything into either black or white.
Good or evil... etc...
By making everything either entirely black or white that makes them feel better.
there is no such thing in what we call "life.
Between white and black there is gray...
It's what lies there that's important.
that is true strength.
Musashi.
The answer is within yourself.
It is truly difficult.
Takuan-sama! I was tricked by Narai Taizō!
I sensed there would be an assassination attempt on the Shōgun ordered by Lord Ikeda Terumasa while that Lord was sojourning at Edo Castle but you were certainly taking part in it...
Takuan-sama! Please spare me!
It's already too late for that.
But I hadn't yet turned that pistol on the Shogun.
spare me! I'll be reborn.
I'll be reborn...
I'm sure! Ow!
Matahachi?
Matahachi!
Ma! You are still alive... You are still alive!
I'll be reborn this time around...
This time around...
I'll be a dutiful son to you!
Matahachi!
Matahachi! Matahachi! Takuan-sama!
Spare him!
Ma... Ma...
Sorry...
I'm sorry... Matahachi? Do it.
Matahachi...
Matahachi...
Matahachi!
Matahachiii! Matahachi...
Ma...
Matahachi. You are reborn.
Don't ever forget the words you spoke earlier.
there... 588.5)}Miyamoto Village
Takezō!
Ma! Ma!
It's Musashi! Musashi's come back!
Takezō... Obaba... Takezō...
Please forgive my many outrages against you up til now!
Just as you said Matahachi was alive!
Obaba. I forgave you from the start.
Takezō... huh?
too.
I see.
I heard Priest Takuan was around... he's gone up to the mountains right now.
aren't I?
Priest Takuan. Musashi.
It's been a long time.
come over here and have a seat.
I was just enjoying the sunset from here.
A sunset expresses the death of a person.
I love sunsets.
Have you become a little more like a human being?
I'm weaker than I was before.
That's good.
I'll be going to Buzen from here. Oh... Why there?
I've decided to fight Sasaki Kojirō and become peerless.
well... huh?
No. As long as the world of the Tokugawa goes on I'll be a mere rōnin my entire life.
My luck ran out for that when I joined the Western Army at Sekigahara.
Is it to make a name for yourself even without a successful career? Or is it to leave your name to posterity as the man who defeated Sasaki Kojirō?
Previously I fought for a successful career and for my honor. I was desperate to raise my reputation in the world. It was with such a selfish desire that I annihilated the Yoshioka School.
I snatched away the lives of more than seventy good people by murdering them.
you will definitely go to Hell.
Yeah.
You don't want a name for yourself.
why do you still go on fighting?
I want to see what's further ahead.
To what?
To what... my limits are.
What lies ahead when Kojirō and I fight.
too.
It may be death.
It may be.
I won't mind.
What about Otsū?
Otsū and I separated in Kyoto and I haven't met her since.
I love Otsū. I'm sure this feeling will never change. Even if Otsū's feelings were to change and she got married for life to some other man my feelings wouldn't change.
I'm sure this feeling wouldn't change even upon my death.
My mind and body will live the way of the sword.
Otsū. Why didn't you come out?
If I had come out now I would have been just a stupid woman detaining Musashi-sama again so I couldn't come out.
Musashi noticed. Otsū. Yes...
And it was with that in mind that he spoke those words.
With just that I am happy. Kokura 90)}Miyamoto Musashi then went to Funashima...
Ganryūjima.
76)}Ganryūjima - i.e. "Ganryū's Island" for Kojirō isn't it?
isn't it! Unusually good weather for this season. what are you planning on doing with that old oar?
Huh?
Ah... they're not half bad.
- A fish with elongated pointed lower jaw
My daughter loves 'em.
Your daughter? I three daughters and a young boy;
we're a five member family.
huh? Well... that's true.
the only merit we all have is that we're healthy! Huh?
I go for a decision.
Over who is the peerless one.
Why does Musashi continue to fight?
Each and every person continues their fight in different forms.
it's your heart fighting against you being lazy every day.
But... I don't bet my life. You did... bet your life.
a fight between two geniuses like Musashi and Kojirō has a different meaning than any normal fight.
For all of human existence itself as well... won't it?
Sorry. Take care of this for me.
And why is that?
Musashi told me he wanted to see what his limits were. too.
let's say that this fan contains all of human potential. let's say this is their store for the future. When someone exceeds their own limits then the store of that potential grows larger.
When Musashi and Kojirō fight they expand those limits... many times over. And with that the potential for humanity as a whole becomes just that much greater.
This fight between those two... isn't it?
590.5)}Funashima (Ganryūjima)
Should've been there for you.
I messed up.
We both did.
It's not that terrible having me here, is it?
(What if she has?
) (Has what? )
(Shagged the neuro reg.) (Ask her.)
Mr Boyle, before you go, I have an admin query.
Did you come straight to us from active service?
Sorry, dying man waiting for me.
You were in breach of your supervisory directive.
You'll be charged with serious professional misconduct.
You'll destroy my career?
VOICES IN BACKGROUND We're evacuating patients, but no-one's telling us where the fire is.
I need information now.
Yes, this is Giles Dhillon, trauma manager.
Do we have a location for the fire alarms yet?
This way.
Theatre changing rooms.
Changing rooms! Staff changing rooms.
This way. Connie... Me, too?
Let's go.
Yes!
Staff changing rooms - on the right.
All clear.
I'm personally leading a trauma team down to the incident now.
Resus trolley straight away, please!
Not until we've cleared it, please.
Quickly!
She's in a bad way. Sister, let's get that trolley, please.
Yes, Mr Boyle.
And a scoop, Harry.
Giles, make sure there's an anaesthetist on their way down, and have the rest of the trauma call divert to Resus.
Yes, Mr Boyle.
You OK?
Yeah.
All clear. The fire's out, but it's still a bit smoky in there.
If anyone starts with any problems breathing, let me know and we'll get out straight away.
Got it. TANNOY: 'Exercise extreme caution 'and report evidence of fire or smoke at once.'
Oh, my God!
Who is she?
Don't know.
Hello?
'Evacuate immediately.
'Alarm areas sounding an intermittent tone.'
Yeah, I thought of that.
Right, we're going to take care of you.
We're going to give you something for the pain.
Give her morphine.

Mrs Hicklin's asked me to check the CCTV.
Male or female?
Female.
CCTV, you show me first.
Yeah, OK...
Starting the clock.
Does anybody recognise her?
There's not much to recognise.
Ramakrishna, I'm leaving you to the airways, Fiona will do primary survey,
Harry will give us venous access, via a large-bore cannula, and then we will immediately give 30 milligrams of ketamine, one gram of paracetamol and one litre of warmed Hartmann's, please.
I've got the ketamine.
I've got the paracetamol and Hartmann's.
Yep.
We're going to need cold swabs.
Yeah, I'll get them.
That's it.
'Evacuate immediately.
'Alarm areas sounding a continuous tone.
'Exercise extreme caution and report evidence of a fire...'
I'm Dr Chandramohan, the anaesthetics registrar.
Can you tell us your name?
Name?
We need to check your airway.
Let's get that scoop out.
Yeah. Make her more comfortable, please.
Unclip top and bottom.
Unclipped. OK.
Brace and to the patient's left. Very gently on three.
One, two, three.
OK, I need to look at her back.

I need to examine you.
Let's keep the non-burnt areas warm, please.
Right you are.
'Alarm areas sounding a continuous tone...'
I'll scribe.
'Alarm areas sounding a continuous tone.
'Exercise extreme caution 'and report evidence of fire or smoke at once.'
Look, we don't know who she is yet, so clear off, please.
Thank you, Nerys.
Can you understand me?
What's your name?
Facial burns, partial-thickness.
Soot in mouth.
Small amount...
Suctioned.
Carbonaceous sputum.
Again, small amount...suctioned.
Singeing of nasal hairs.
Good peripheral perfusion.
OK, someone has got to have seen her go into the changing room?
Giles is checking the CCTV.
Has anybody seen Lorraine today?
Oh, my God.
It's Lorraine?
We don't know who it is.
That's right. We don't.
I'm calling the Burns Unit.
Excuse me.
Look, everyone, I know this is not easy, but please can we just treat her like any other patient.
Yeah, this is Mrs Hicklin.
Can you put me through to the consultant on call for Burns?
Can you open your mouth for me, my sweet?
I can't get anything.
Keep trying.
Any intra-oral burns, oedema?
No signs of either. Upper airway appears clear.
I need to give you some oxygen, my love.
The mask might be a bit uncomfortable while the painkillers kick in.
OK, well done.
100% O2, 15 litres a minute.
Just waiting for the sats reading to come up.
Vitesh, Nicola Hicklin.
We have a woman over here at CGH with greater than 50% full and partial-thickness burns.
No, we've no ID yet.
I'll let you know.
OK, cheers, Vitesh.
Reasonable ventilation across both lung fields.
Good carotid and femoral pulses.
Widespread full and partial-thickness burns across the chest.
Can you upload the referral form to the Central Infirmary Burns Unit once we've got all the necessary information?
Yeah.
Adding to that, that we believe it may be a member of staff.
Of course, Fiona.
Oxygen saturation?
100.
We'll confirm that with ABGs.
OK, so better iv access first, tube second, ABGs third.
Let's do it.
Subclavian line.
'Alarm areas sounding a continuous tone, evacuate immediately.'
Can you do us a favour and bleep the consultant anaesthetist on call.
What did your last slave die of?
That's a bit racist.
Go away, please!
I'm pausing the primary survey till the patient gets something for the pain.
I've done you 30 of ket, Lomas. It's in there.
Thank you.
You'll feel a sharp scratch just underneath your collar bone.
OK, we're going to take care of you.
We're going to give you something for the pain.
Yes, I'm calling on behalf of Dr Chandramohan.
Could you fast bleep Dr Molloy?
So, this will be the sequence of events.
Once Ramakrishna has cannulated the subclavian vein, he'll take a syringe of blood.
Harry, you'll receive that syringe and you'll send it for FBC, U and E's, GS, TEG, EtOH, beta-HCG and drug screen.
And don't forget the drug screen.
ABGs to follow, including carboxyhaemoglobin.
Yes.
Yes.
No... MOLLOY.
Consultant anaesthetist. Yes.
Yeah, that's it.
Thanks.
FIRE ALARM ENDS Thank God for that.
Send those straight off, come back for an ABG.
(What's going on?
SHE GROANS Can someone prep me for an art line, please?
I'll get it.
Mrs Hicklin, can we catheterise the patient so we can monitor her urine output, and start a fluid chart, please?
OK.
Sister, let's prepare some sterilised gauze to remove any loose flesh or burnt clothing.
And let's source some clingfilm please.
Yes, Mr Boyle.
Justin, burns kit.
We haven't had the handover yet.
I was in the male changing room.
Heard shouting and ran over to the female side.
She'd barricaded herself in, so it was hard work getting to her, but luckily, there was an extinguisher in the corridor, so...
You put the fire out?
Yes.
Well done.
Yes.
Well done.
We're going to give you something to make you comfortable.
Ketamine and paracetamol given.
Thank you.
Hartmann's running in.
You're going to feel a strange feeling at the top of your chest.
That's just the fluid running in.
OK.
Resuming the primary survey.
Bloods have gone.
Cheers.
Harry, ABG.
(You bastard.)
She's very pink.
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Cherry.
She was in an enclosed space.
She's hypoxic.
Can't be. Her sats are still 100.
Guedel, oxygen.
Yep. Diazemuls.
Need to oxygenate.
But what about the sats?
Shut up, Billy.
Come on, Justin, come on. JUSTIN:
Coming, coming, coming!
GLEN:
It's OK... Shit!
Come on!
Shit!
Shit! Come on, Justin, come on.
Coming, coming!
Yep.
Diazemuls ten milligram iv, given.
It's OK, you're OK.
(OK.)
Good. What's her carboxyhaemoglobin?
30% and her CO2 is 12 point...
Whatever, she's got severe CO toxicity.
I need to tube her now.
We. Thio 125, sux.
Get the GlideScope ready.
Yep. Ready for the cricoid?
Yeah. Done it before?
Yeah.
Thiopentone, 125...in.
Come on, Billy, come on!
You'll have it.
Breath sounds diminishing...
Come on!
Sux, 100...
Yeah.

Bougie at the ready.
Lady wand.
Not the time or the place, Billy.
(Shit!
Not liking what I'm seeing...
ALARM BEEPS (Shit!
)
Tube.
She's on the bougie.
Yep.
Subglottic oedema.
OK.
Shit.
Shit.
It's closing off the airway. Can we get the tube in?
I need you to tell me what's happening.
Laryngeal mask.
Yeah, copy that.
Backs! Mini-Trach, gloves and gown, please, now.
Need an answer, Ramakrishna.
I NEED an ANSWER.
There you go.
Yeah, OK.
OK, LMA in place.
Oh, Godsake, why me?
VF arrest.
Get me gloves, please.
Femoral absent, carotid absent.
Compressions and defibrillation.
OK, so we're bagging via LMA, so it's 30:2.
Go.
CONTINUOUS ALARM
OK, go.
150 biphasic. 150 biphasic.
DEFIBRILLATOR: '150 joules biphasic shock.
'Charging.
'Charged.
Prepare for shock.
'Warning.
Stand clear.
'Warning.
Stand clear.' Shocking in three.
Everybody off.
Oxygen away, Justin off the chest.
One, two, three... shock.
Back in. Come on.
Restart compressions.
Two minutes of CPR, please.
I'm not happy with this ventilation.
I'm going to try and tube her again at the end of this cycle.
OK.
What's the smallest tube you've got there?
6.0.
So what's the story with the sats?
Pulse ox misreads carbon monoxide poisoning as a normal oxygen saturation.
I knew that.
Yeah. Radiographer.
Sorry.
Well done for rescuing her from that fire.
30 seconds gone, 90 to go.
I want to apologise for badgering you over apparent discrepancies in your CV.
An Army contact told me what happened.
Right.
No wonder you needed some time off.
Your actions in Afghanistan were admirable.
Thank you.
60 seconds gone, 60 to go.
OK, let's use this time to calculate surface area of burns.
Anyone?
By rule of nines and with visual estimation, it's 65%.
OK.
Using the Parkland formula, with estimated weight of 60 kilos that gives us four times 60 times 65 which equals 15.6 litres over the first 24 hours with 50% given over in first eight hours, ie 7.8 litres.
Good. 65% of body surface area is burned.
Gives her a 50% chance of survival.
As per Harry's calculation, that's one litre per hour for the first eight hours.
Did you really work that out for yourself or did you cheat?
Five seconds.
We weren't even going out properly at the time and you were acting like an arse.
So no change there, then.
Time. I need to get in during the pulse check.
OK.
Need quick hands, Billy.
Charging.
DEFIBRILLATOR: 'Shock charging. 'Charged. Ready to shock.
Warning, stand clear.'
I need to get in.
It's oxygenation that she needs.
GLEN:
Delay shock. Justin, off the chest.
Femoral absent, carotid absent.
OK, let's go.
OK, tube in! Get in!
DEFIBRILLATOR: 'Ready to shock...' Shocking after three.
Everybody clear. Oxygen away.
One, two, three.
Compressions, come on.
Another two minutes of CPR.
Time is 22 minutes and 30 seconds.
Let's be ready with adrenaline for after this cycle, please.
OK, we can go asynchronous now.
That Mini fell through.
The black one with the 20 thou on the clock.
Guy got a better offer.
I'm gutted.
OK, we're moving more air now.
We've got ROSC.
Can we stop CPR, please?
Sinus.
Carotid output, femoral output.
OK, OK, that's well done, everybody.
Let's get a plain chest film, please, and then we're going to transfer her to the Burns Unit.
Portable machine's in use.
OK to move the patient down to the overhead?
OK, let's go. Quick as we can please, quick as we can.
Go. Get going.
NICOLA: Harry, you should be back in ED.
TANNOY: 'Will all staff please return to their stations?
' HE KNOCKS 'Will all staff return to their stations?
Thank you.'
Security sent me the CCTV footage.
MACHINE BEEPS Rays in three.
One, two, three...rays.
Patient is intubated and ventilated.
Tonic-clonic seizure and VF arrest due to CO toxicity, but she's stable now.
All clear.
Get in there and finish the clingfilm, please.
OK. Thanks, boss.
Image on screen.
Doesn't look good.
MACHINE BEEPS RAPIDLY Got a problem.
Move, please.
Chest compliance is down.
Poor oxygenation.
The burns are constricting her chest.
She needs escharotomies.
Right now, please.
OK.
This is Fiona Lomas, trauma reg.
Could you fast-bleep Trauma theatre staff urgently, please.
What's that she's got there?
Sanitizer gel.
Highly flammable.
After she barricades herself in, nothing happens for some time.
Oh, God.
I'd best tell the trauma team.
I don't think that's a good idea.
They need to know who their patient is.
I don't think that's going to help anybody right now.
MACHINES BEEP Diathermy, please.
Thank you. Swabs, please.
Chest compliance is even worse.
Her lungs are getting really badly compressed.
OK.
That loosened the chest.
Lung compliance and tidal volumes are still way down.
Hi, boss.
We've some real issues with ventilation here.
Emergency escharotomies are in progress.
Right.
It's definitely Lorraine.
I thought you should know.
You don't have to do this.
Yes, I do.
It's not changing.
It's not enough.
You need to release more scar tissue.
OK, we'll do transverse incisions.
I can do it if you want.
I'm doing it.
Chest compliance improving, tidal volumes increasing.
Tidal volume continues to improve.
End tidal CO2 is dropping, sats now rising.
I'm happy to do the transfer.
I'll call my opposite number in the Burns Unit.
Let's get her a face mask.
Prep her for the Burns Unit, please.
Face mask, burns box, resus.
Cheers, Billy.
She stands a decent chance.
Of what?
A lifetime of pain and disfigurement?
She was misguided.
I had to challenge her, for the good of the department.
(Yeah.)
There are HUNDREDS of members of staff whose careers, livelihoods and families depend on the success of this unit.
I couldn't let one person derail that.
No, you couldn't.
Anything to say?
Who told you?
Doesn't matter.
I've been told.
If I ever thought Lorraine would do something like this...
What?
Then you wouldn't have ruined her career?
The only thing Lorraine ever did was challenge the way you run this department.
We don't yet know the range of emotions that motivated her.
No?
Someone should inform the next of kin. Well, not you.
There's a husband and two young children.
Joshua's six, Olivia's four.
'John Rappaport.'
Mr Rappaport... My name's Fiona Lomas.
I'm one of Lorraine's junior colleagues.
'Yes?
I have very bad news.
I'm afraid Lorraine's been involved in an accident at work.
She has sustained severe burns.
'My God.'
We're transferring her to the Burns Unit at the Central Infirmary... ..and I think it would be best if you made your way there directly.
'Yes, I will.'
I am so sorry to have to give this news over the phone.
Mr Rappaport...
Fiona...
I've got it.
Mr Rappaport, it's Giles Dhillon.
I'm very sorry.
Sats are still dropping.
Have you checked the circuit?
Ramakrishna, what's happening?
No.
No, there's no leaks, no.
Must be the tube. Yeah.
Another 6.0.
Yeah.
No, make it a 5.5.
Tell me.
We're not ventilating the lungs.
Sats are now 80%.
Yeah, I can read.
(Come on.)
Facial oedema's pulling out the bloody tube!
Off the vent.
Yeah. Crike set!
Crike, over here.
Yes, got it.
Come on, move.
No, bougie.
There you go.
Ties!
Tube.
Get it out. Yep.
OK.
Sats are now 60%.
Ramakrishna, I'm giving you ten seconds.
Nine.
Eight.
Seven.
Six.
Five.
Four.
Three.
Shit.
Two.
One.
Blade, please.
Clear, clear.
Haemostat.
Trach.
Inflate, please.
Ventilating.
Good.
Thanks.
Patient back on vent. Sutures.
Cut it.
OK.
We keep her warm and then we transfer her to the Burns Unit.
Yep.
Let's make sure she gets there this time.
Brake on.
Moving on three, everyone ready?
Yep.
One, two, three.
I'll call as soon as I hand her over to the Burns Team.
Transit time is five, ten minutes right?
Nearer five.
OK, good.
MACHINE BEEPS I need to unstrap.
HE SIGHS You got 200mg of hydrocortisone?
Great, thank you.
We've got a bit of a problem back here, we need to get down ASAP.
Shit.
Got suction?
Sorry.
Oh, shit.
Come on.
CONTINUOUS BEEP Shit.
Oh, shit!
Can you do compressions?
I need to bag her.
Not enough room.
We're going to be landing ASAP.
I should bag...
We're going to be landing.
You need to be strapped...
I need to bag her!
Locked and tight in the front.
Locked and tight to the back.
Down.
Ambubag and adrenaline.
Get on the chest, mate.
Right.
Adrenaline given.
She's drowning.
Massive ARDS reaction to smoke inhalation.
We're done.
This is a coroner job, so we need to leave everything attached.
Sorry, mate.
We'll take her in.
Thanks.
Mate, it's Billy.
All right.
HE SIGHS I've got it.
Billy?
It's Giles again. Ramakrishna, stay where you are and I'll organise some transport for you.
She died en route.
Yes, she's here.
Dr Bennett-Edwardes, he wants to talk to you.
Er, yeah, tell him I'll ring him.
She's going to give you a call.
It must have been a terrible ordeal and we're all thinking of you.
Yep. I'll call you back when I know who's coming to get you.
Fiona...
Fiona! She didn't even get there.
You bastard!
I'm terribly, terribly sorry.
Stop!
You will stop!
I'm so sorry, baby.
No.
There's something I need you to see.
Please.
OK.
I wasn't on active service when you called me.
My last deployment finished months ago.
I've been on...
I've been on long-term leave.
What is this?
It's a helmet camera.
It's not mine.
It's our... forward operating base in Afghanistan.
The guy shooting at us is Afghan.
He's meant to be one of ours.
We shot him three times.
He was your friend?
He was.
I thought I knew him.
SOLDIER: 'I need a medic!
Why didn't you tell me? What?
I...
Because I'd have known?
Known?
Known what?
That this is why you're here.
Another chance to save lives.
And now look.
Lorraine...
Lorraine wasn't anyone's fault... ..but Clive's.
Hah! OK.
And your friend... ..you did the best you could for him.
You don't understand.
OK.
I can't... ..pretend to understand what you've been through...
..but it wasn't your fault.
You couldn't save him.
I wasn't trying to save him!
I wasn't trying to save him.
It was completely the opposite.
Hey.
I'm looking for the call room.
Down that hall, hang a right.
Mozart.
29th symphony.
Who's conducting?
Dr. Hamza.
It's brain surgery.
Huh. In c minor.
Impressive.
Still, give me Dean Martin every time.
Thank you for the directions.
So, everything that you'll need to get you through the next few hours...
A survival kit.
Thank you.
Saltine crackers, fruity lip balm.
Who are you calling a fruity lip balm?
Sour candies to absorb the toxicity. Oh, Gatorade?
Sudoku?
Our kids are almost identical.
See? Great minds think alike, huh?
Guess you don't need me at all. No, sweetheart.
You are exactly what I need.
Thank you for this.
Yeah.
Okay.
Onwards to chemo.
If you're looking for the call room, you already passed it.
Well, Charlie Harris.
How'd you know?
Oh, same old Bishop.
Brilliant with a scalpel, lousy with directions.
Well, some things never change, like your handwriting.
Still chicken scratches.
That's what makes me so popular with the staff.
So, I guess the rumors about you joining us are true, then?
Yeah, after training in L.A.
Got tired of bleach-blond nurses and gunshot wounds, huh?
- Never a dull moment.
- No, not with you around.
Buckle up... Medics are coming in hot with two cirque performers who just fell 20 feet. Illyana!
Let's go.
Illyana!
Uh, Jeremy Bishop. It's my first day.
Zach Miller. Welcome.
So, what happened?
He fell off a trapeze?
Kind of fitting for your first day.
I'm more of a high wire myself.
Okay, on three.
One, two, three.
All right, what's your name?
Kurt.
But you have to help her.
His aerial partner's a minute out.
Cirque de ciel, huh?
I used to date a girl from the Yorrick Company.
She was a contortionist.
Yeah, you're right... Some things don't change.
Illyana!
Illyana? Relax, relax, relax.
- Please, I need to see her.
- Just relax.
Calm down for me, Kurt, all right?
You guys got him?
Yeah!
Okay, 1 milligram of ketamine for the pain.
Okay, Kurt. Hey, hey, Kurt, Kurt, look at me.
Out of the way, please.
Look at me. I need you to focus, okay?
Can you wiggle your fingers for me?
Now your toes.
That's very good. Okay, I need to reduce this hip.
All right, I'll stabilize.
Hey, bear with me, buddy.
That should give you enough torque.
Okay, relax. Relax your leg.
Relax your leg. Okay.
Kurt, I'm gonna be putting your hip back in place.
You're gonna feel some pain, followed by a pop, all right?
On three.
One, two, and three.
Okay.
And like a glove.
You should put on some doctory clothes.
Greatest show on earth, right, Charlie?
Yeah.
Spine's intact, but... she's unresponsive.
I'll have her tested for brain death.
Illyana?
Illyana?
- It's half past already.
- I'm sorry!
We got back late from the cottage.
Um, we were supposed to study before rounds.
I know, but it was so hard to leave.
It was beautiful there.
Except for the mosquitoes. They were huge!
You should have seen the size of them.
They were like vampire bats.
And for whatever reason, they were only biting me.
You should see my back. I'm covered in bites.
I can't stop scratching.
Except some of them, I can't really reach 'cause they're in the middle of my back.
Would you mind rubbing this bite stuff on me?
Oh! Who are you?
!
- I'm a doctor. - So am I!
Good!
So why are we yelling?
! I...
I want to be with her.
I'm... I'm sorry, that's - that's not possible.
She's gone. I know.
[Inhales sharply but I... I should be with her.
It's... it's not fair that she's alone.
Right.
Well, I'm... I'm gonna make sure you have a chance to say a proper goodbye, all right?
Um... I just need you to lift up your arm for me.
Kurt, did you know that Illyana had agreed to be an organ donor?
Yeah, of course.
We signed our cards together.
Okay, well, of course, we're gonna need a final consent if there are any family members.
There aren't.
I'm her only family.
Well, Illyana is gonna be able to help more people today than she ever could have imagined.
What do you mean?
Um... Illyana is a match for a patient waiting for a kidney transplant.
That patient's fiance wanted to donate his, but they weren't a match.
But Illyana is?
Yeah, it's... it's actually...
It's even better than that. See, the, um... The patient's fiance has agreed to... to give his kidney to someone else, and that patient's donor partner has also consented.
We call all of this a domino transplant.
Basically... Four people are gonna have a second shot at life today, and three people are willing to put their lives on the line... all because of Illyana.
Seriously, are you... Are you hearing this?
It's nothing.
Um... Okay, I'm... I'm gonna be back in a bit to, uh... to, um, put a proper cast on that.
So why don't you get some rest, okay?
- Shahir.
- Hm?
Second aerial performer...
Female, 26, brain death.
She's on life support.
That's awful, Alex.
She's an organ donor.
Okay.
Who's O-neg with a 6 antigen match.
Shahir, she's the perfect donor for Terry Brown.
You're talking about the domino transplant?
When's the last time you saved four lives in a single day?
We'll need to organize our surgeries so the wait time for each recipient is as soon as possible.
They'll need to be off of dialysis and ready to go as soon as their organs arrive.
We'll also need a team to confirm that the recipients are prepped and in the O.R. By the time their kidneys arrive.
This is Keith. He's our last recipient.
But he's in severe renal failure and can't travel to Hope Zion, so we will coordinate with St. Donald's to deliver his kidney.
This is all hands on deck.
I'm gonna bring in the junior residents.
Williams and Mirani will keep things moving.
We'll get Sekara to be our gopher for the day.
The most important thing to remember is, we've got one shot at this.
Seven surgeries.
Four harvest and three transplants in the next few hours before the final kidney goes to St. Donald's children's hospital.
If something goes wrong with one...
And the dominoes stop falling, so no screw-ups.
Everyone, Dr. Jeremy Bishop, our newest gen-surg on staff.
- I'm Alex.
- Reid.
Yeah.
You need no introduction.
Charlie's told me a lot about you. Thank you for diving in.
Some of our junior residents.
Check the board, make sure you know where...
How are the bug bites?
We'll be the first in the city to lead a multi-hospital domino transplant.
Doogie. How's it going?
Okay, Maggie, take Dev and start the first harvest.
Cassie and Asha, I'll need you to coordinate.
I'll be handling all of the transplants.
Dr. Bishop, want to do something fun today?
Giddyup.
Wait a sec.
Everybody huddle in.
Come on. "Domino" on three.
Three, two, one...
Domino!
Whoo! I've always wanted to do that.
Dr. Kowalski, phone call on line 1.
Dr. Kowalski, line 1.
What year is it?
Sorry?
The magazine.
Uh... Uh, 2003.
Why would we want to read articles from so many years ago?
You know, we're cancer patients, not historians.
Josh Lewis, professor of 18th-century poetry.
Or, well, I was until...
Has the, uh, has the nurse been in yet?
No. It's hurry up and wait.
Well, they have to test our blood first, so...
Yeah, make sure it's okay to poison it.
Yeah, the irony's not lost on me. But, then, nothing about this place makes any sense.
I mean...
I mean, I know... let's get all the sick people, we'll put them in one place, and then have them treated by some semi-socialized beaker head with a God complex.
Sorry. Didn't catch your name.
Dana.
But most people around here call me Dr. Kinney.
Dr. Kinney.
Look at that.
What's the news, Dawson?
You're good to go.
Let's get you started on the docetaxel.
Yum, yum.
I'm a doctor, too.
Doctor of old poems.
You writing a book?
Trying to.
Thought I might have at least one great novel in me.
Although, now it turns out it might have to be a novella.
Or it might just be, you know, a professional hazard.
Teaching all that great literature, making me think I can do it, too.
Speaking of professional hazards...
Doctor becomes a patient, huh?
Mm. All done.
You're next up, Josh.
You guys need anything, I'm your gal today.
Thank you, Dawson.
You know, it must be hard, knowing all the facts, to still believe you can actually beat this.
I'm putting both of you under at the same time.
No food, no drinks, so finish up your beers, boys.
You ready to get off dialysis?
Hell yeah, he's ready.
We got a wedding to plan.
So, we got transport on standby to take your kidney to St. Donald's.
Dr. Reid will be with you shortly.
You ready, Erin?
My twins turn 7 next week.
I've been on dialysis since they were 4 years old. So yeah.
I'm ready.
It's been a long road.
Thank you.
We're just waiting for your donor.
Larry's not big on cellphones.
All he's got is this old flip, and the battery's always dead.
Well, time is of the essence, Emma.
He can't just disappear like this.
He'll be here, honey.
Larry doesn't have time for a lot of people, but his big sister's one of them.
Nobody can help an old guy with a chair, huh?
- Larry!
- Larry.
Must've passed a dozen orderlies schlepping this damn thing.
You'd think one of them would have lifted their finger before Liz Taylor here.
Got your chair.
Larry... They found a donor.
What?
I'm getting my kidney.
The right donor came in to trigger the domino chain. It is our lucky break.
I wasn't expecting this today.
Well, yes, I know. This is all coming very fast.
But we need to move now.
We'll get you into surgery shortly.
But, uh...
I was just reading this thing online.
A guy gave his kidney, and... and, um... He developed an unexplainable appetite for pumpkin pie. Wouldn't eat anything else...
Just pumpkin pie, pumpkin pie, day after day.
I hate pumpkin pie.
Are you seriously talking about pie right now?
I...
I just need time to process this, Emma.
Dr. Reid, Maggie sent me down.
Something wrong, Dr. Reid?
It's fine.
Just try to relax.
Excuse me.
What's going on?
It's the cadaveric donor.
We lost the right kidney.
How bad is it, Maggie?
Right kidney's lost blood supply.
It's a goner. Left one is hypoplastic.
So, we are looking at a small kidney with a crazy arterial network.
Might be too many to anastomose.
Well, Terry's prepped.
They haven't opened him up yet.
What do you want to do?
I promised four patients they were getting off dialysis today.
That is still the plan.
Okay, we will cut a piece of her aorta, use it to make an arterial cuff around the renal arteries, and then we'll have one in anastomosis instead of three.
Okay.
Go get ready for the next harvest, please. Mm-hmm.
Somebody page Dr. Bishop.
All right, ureter is free.
Just the artery cuff to go.
So, the weather's great in L.A. why'd you come back?
I tried an emergency spinal corpectomy on a 15-year-old car crash victim.
Did they die?
No. No, I saved her life.
And I still got sued anyway.
Wow. That is rough.
Yeah.
They had more lawyers on staff than doctors.
Suction.
I wasn't getting any better...
Just safer. From everything I've heard about you, caution isn't really your thing.
The way you're working those scissors, I'd say it's not yours, either.
Okay.
Here we go. Got it.
Start perfusion and get it ready for transplant.
Kristine.
Oh, hey.
Have you, um, seen a, uh...
Uh, yeah.
I've seen her. I've been hearing her all day, too.
Yeah. I've been trying to talk to her.
No, she doesn't want to talk.
I don't think she wants any help at all.
Okay, well, what does she want?
Uh, well, what do you know about her?
Uh... She's a trapeze artist.
Her and her partner took a bad fall.
He managed to pull through, but she's having her... harvested as we speak.
Ohhh. That's so sad.
I-I think I actually know the song.
"My pigeon home," it's called.
It's a lullaby.
- Lullaby?
- Mm. So she's trying to put us to sleep.
Not working.
Well, it's a song about reuniting.
I think she might be trying to convince someone to join her.
When we met, I was the water boy for my high school basketball team, and I got stuffed in a locker after practice.
Did Dan save you?
No.
I was in the one next to him.
Sounds romantic.
Oh, it was.
Took three hours till the janitor found us.
What were you screaming, again?
"My legs... I can't feel my legs."
Sounds hilarious.
We knew if we could make it through high school together, we could make it through anything.
So far, we have.
Time to go in.
Take good care of him.
Don't tell me you don't know the story of Abelard and Heloise.
No, but I have a funny feeling you're about to tell me.
12th century, Paris.
Heloise is this whip-smart student who wants the answer to human existence.
Well, that was her first mistake.
So she goes to study with Pierre Abelard, who's the greatest scholar in France at the time...
About 20 years her senior.
Nothing wrong with that.
Well, it was for her Uncle Fulbert.
He found out about their affair, beat the living crap out of Abelard.
The lovers were banished to live apart forever.
They corresponded by love letters for the rest of their lives.
So? What do you think?
Do you ever stop talking?
Um...
When I'm sleeping, I guess.
Oh! Well, then, night-night, professor.
Oh, I'm sorry.
You want one?
Not unless there's weed in them.
No way.
Which part of "I'm a poetry professor" didn't you understand?
Well, then, what the Heloise are you waiting for?
Pass me a pot cookie.
Dr. Reid.
Pali. What's up?
I wanted to give this to her.
Or to him... whoever's donating to Erin.
The donors are all anonymous.
I can't give you a name.
I-I know, but the girls made me promise that I would give it to the person that helped their mommy get better.
Right.
I will see what I can do.
Thank you.
You don't know what it's like sitting there helpless while your best friend just gets sicker and sicker.
Of course you know what it's like.
You're a doctor.
I... So you get why it's so important to me that that gets to Erin's donor?
Uh, yeah, just...
I'm sorry.
Excuse me.
Is everything okay?
Larry?
Oh! Where are you going?
Home.
What?
Why?
I'm not doing it.
I thought I was ready, but I'm not.
I only came in today to drop off my sister's chair.
Okay, I know that all of this has been sprung on you, and you're probably incredibly overwhelmed, but...
All due respect, you have no idea what I'm going through.
I made a decision.
I'm just asking you to please respect that and leave me the hell alone.
Don't let him leave the building.
- Berger is still in the building.
- What? That was Zach.
He spotted him pacing by the coffee kiosk.
Which means he's waffling.
Yes, which also means we have until he gets to the bottom of his latte to get him back on board.
All right.
I got this.
Hey, Larry.
Hi.
How do you know my name?
My name's Dr. Bishop.
It's my first day here.
Congratulations.
I'm leaving. Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Just... Just hear me out...
Just for a second.
I just moved back here from L.A.
I was there training under this Dr. Pearlman.
Amazing surgeon.
Genius.
Also... a very pious man.
And he taught me a lot of things.
Including this Hebrew phrase... "tikkun olam."
It's from the talmud.
It means "repairing the world."
Says all of humanity has a shared responsibility to heal and transform the world.
Why are you telling me this?
Dr. Pearlman, he'd remind us about "tikkun olam" before every surgery we did.
Larry, I think you have a chance to heal the world today in the simplest, most pure kind of way.
And I know you're scared.
I get that.
I really do.
I swear. But I think it's something worth considering.
And I don't think you'd still be here if you didn't think so, too.
My mind's made up.
The answer's no.
I'm sorry.
No.
So, there's these, um...
Hm? Um, you know...
You know... Double doors... the kind that open in the center, and, um... But one of the hinges was broken, so... they...
they kept that locked. But he didn't know that.
So, anyway, you know, he's finally ready, and he's got, you know, his tray of cheese, you know, it's just right.
And he's carrying it like it's, you know, the most precious thing in the entire world.
And then bam!
His nose goes into the glass, tray goes everywhere.
There's, like, honey all over his beard.
Oh. I've come unstuck.
Whoopsie.
Hang on.
- Here. Let me.
Here.
Should you be doing this?
Why not?
Because I'm a...
What'd you say?
A beaker head with a God complex?
No.
'Cause you're higher than a lab monkey.
What is going on here?
Um...
Relax. Josh just popped his I.V.
I got it back in.
No, you can't do that.
I'm sorry, but this isn't your charge, Dr. Kinney.
The hell it isn't.
I'm a surgeon.
Not in here, you're not.
Then what am I?
I'm sorry?
If I'm not a surgeon, well, what am I?
A dead duck.
That's...
That's what he said.
I didn't... That's what you implied.
In here, you're just my patient.
Right.
So, what are my chances of surviving this?
Dr. Kinney.
No, seriously.
I have a reoccurrence of stage 3 metastatic breast cancer, so what are the odds I'll be here...
By Christmas?
That's not fair.
You stay out of this.
As your patient, Dawson, I am asking.
I do... I... I'm not...
I don't feel comfortable answering that. No.
Of course you don't.
I'm sorry.
I'm... I didn't mean to be...
You're all good now, Josh.
Thank you.
Okay, then.
Um... I'll be back in a bit to check on you both.
Great.
Where did you two meet?
Uh... At auditions for cirque.
Two total misfits.
Her parents, Russian immigrants, kicked her out of the house when she was 14.
Mine... hardly even noticed I was gone.
She understood me.
Yeah, I guess when you meet someone like that... who gets you, quirks and all... nothing else really matters, right?
Dr. Harris?
Time of death... 3:13 P.M.
Kurt?
Let's get him back to his room. Okay.
I don't believe it.
It's my fault. I pushed him too hard.
It's no one's fault.
He's never been very good with surprises.
When we were kids, I used to jump out behind corners, and one time...
She popped out, and I hit her square in the mouth.
15 stitches.
I told you he'd come 'round.
You were right.
I am scared.
I've been scared my whole life.
You've always been this golden child...
Good grades...
Good friends.
We'll give you two some privacy.
I've always been this neurotic mess.
That's not true.
It is.
Everyone thought it was a joke when I said I would donate.
But you stood up for me.
We're in a good place, Emma.
I don't want it to stop.
It won't. You're my brother.
That is never gonna change.
Ohhh, boy.
Uh, hey, Alex, I need you to come take a look at this.
What do we have? A frozen kidney.
Larry put us behind schedule.
It must have been too close to the ice for too long.
Even if we thaw that, we've got little chance of getting it to perfuse.
We've come too far to turn back now.
So, what do you want to do?
Get me 10 bags of warm saline.
And a blowtorch.
Kidding! Hold the blowtorch.
All right, then.
That freezing didn't do us any favors, but the warm saline flush... It looked good.
You think it'll live?
It has to.
Okay.
Suturing the renal vein.
Renal vein and artery are anastomose.
Okay. Moment of truth.
Let's release those clamps and pray that it takes.
Exactly.
Oh, come on.
Come on.
Let's go.
Okay. We got good perfusion.
Yes!
Hey, do you mind doing the ureter anastomosis?
I have to go check in on Larry, make sure he's all right.
You got it.
Thanks, Bishop.
How did it go?
This is odd.
What? He should be waking up now.
Heart rate's skyrocketing.
Alex? He could be having a stroke.
Page shahir.
Let's get him up to imaging... now.
Okay.
Good catch, Alex.
It was a stroke.
He's coning.
The swelling from the epidural bleed is pressing on his brain stem.
There. That should relieve the pressure.
Alex, it's okay.
You can go. I've done plenty of these.
Turn up the music, please.
Thank you.
My daughter, Molly, is, um... studying psychology at Queens.
She wants to be a couples counselor, of all things.
I haven't told her yet...
That it's back.
Toughest thing in the world...
Watching your kid trying to be brave...
No matter how old they are.
Especially when you know the real truth.
Yeah, I'd like to apologize for that.
No.
Why?
It's the truth.
Okay.
Then I say we - we double down on this...
"Stranger on a train" vibe we got going here.
Let's tell each other one thing that we've never told another living soul.
Okay.
Yeah? Who goes first?
I don't know.
You want to rock, paper, scissors?
Oh, careful.
You're gonna pull out your I.V. again.
I'll go.
I don't want to do this again.
I don't want to sit here, getting sicker and sicker.
I want to...
I want to get on a plane. I want to fly away.
Your turn.
Well, I want to come with you.
If looks could kill, I'd be the ghost right now.
Well, look at it this way.
What would you be capable of if somebody tried to keep Alex away from you?
So, how do we help her if she won't talk to us?
I don't know.
You know, maybe he doesn't see her, maybe he doesn't hear her, but if he feels her, if he senses that she's here...
Then what?
He won't move on, either?
He won't get better?
That's a bit of a stretch, don't you think?
Charlie. I'm just saying, it's not very scientific.
No, look.
Illyana, you need to talk to us.
He needs to be with me.
It was your time.
It's not his. You need to accept that.
He won't make it without me.
He's gonna have to try.
I won't go without him.
I can't. Something's wrong.
Illyana, what are you doing?
I love him too much.
His heart rate's through the roof.
You need to go now!
I can't.
I won't.
He's got a petechial rash.
We need to get him to radiology right now.
Could be a fat embolus in his lungs.
Bone marrow may have seeped out of the break and migrated.
- Can you fix him?
Come on.
Illyana!
Stop!
Call the code.
We need a crash cart. Look, Charlie.
Code blue, E.T. wing 203.
Code blue, E.T. wing 203.
Kurt never had a chance.
I'm really not in the mood to see the bright side.
People who love each other that much belong together, even in death.
I'm not buying that.
I had a daughter.
Maddie.
It was 4:00 in the afternoon.
Not even happy hour.
This guy's all over the road.
He's coming right at us.
I tried to get out of the way, but there wasn't enough time.
We didn't... we didn't have enough time.
My little girl.
Kris.
I wanted to die... so I could be with her.
I'm sorry.
I had no idea.
When I woke up in the hospital... She was gone.
But there were all these other spirits that only I could see.
There's still so much I'm trying to figure out about this... This thing we have.
Well, maybe we could help each other, you know?
Figure this thing out together.
I'd like that, Charlie.
Last ones.
I'm glad to see you. Yeah, model patients.
Transplants went off without a hitch.
Pali, your kidney is taking a little trip to close out the domino.
It's going to somebody who desperately needs it.
Thank you.
You're welcome. You were badass, Alex.
Yeah, she's not wrong.
All right, girls.
On to recovery ice cream.
So?
So, he's gonna make a full recovery.
Thank God.
One more transport to go, Alex, and you've pulled it off.
Not me... all of us.
Hey. Nice ride.
Oh, yeah.
Thanks. How'd it go?
Exhausting, but, um... eventful.
I met a boy.
At chemo?
Yes.
And he's a poet. And he asked to come to Paris with me because he wants to show me where Abelard and Heloise are buried.
Dana.
And I said "yes."
You just started chemo.
I know, but I'm...
I'm thinking that I just have to fight this in a different way for a while.
I'm sorry, but this is insane.
Actually, I think this is the sanest thing I have done in a long time.
You're flying off to Paris with a poet that you met a few hours ago.
Well, when you put it like that...
Instead of prolonging your life... Alex.
I don't want to prolong my life.
I want to live it.
Hey.
How you feeling?
Like I just got run over.
You?
Same.
I wanted to, um...
Well...
I, um...
Oh, it's a...
- Limerick, yeah. - Yeah.
Uh... It was the only rhyme scheme I could remember, and I'm half-Irish, so...
"A terminal lass from Kilbride was befuddled by fear and by pride."
Hm. "Till she heard a sweet man say he'd come with her partway.
So she kissed him, she smiled, and she cried."
Thank you, doctor.
So... How does it end?
The story?
Oh.
- Heloise.
- Right. Does she find the real meaning of life?
Oh, she does.
Oh, yeah?
The love she found with Abelard...
That was the meaning of human existence.
Oh. Love.
Hey.
What's going on?
Nothing.
Look, I get it, Greg is your Jacob, but we all know you're going to end up with Edward.
Because you're Bella.
What is that reference?
It's on the tip of my tongue.
It's...
Twilight.
Twilight, yes.
It's only the greatest love story - since Shakespeare...
In Love.
- Right. Yeah.
Right, yeah, okay.
What are you talking about again?
You spent Thanksgiving with Greg, and that was not part of our plan.
You need to be with Josh.
If not for you, then for me.
- Why?
- I need this.
My marriage is like The Walking Dead, okay?
We are all just trying to get out alive.
You and Josh, your love story... it gives me hope.
What love story?
♪ I was working hard at a New York job ♪
♪ Making dough but it made me blue ♪

No, I'm not.
♪ She's the crazy ex-girlfriend ♪
That's a sexist term.
♪ She's the crazy ex-girlfriend ♪

The situation's a lot more nuanced than that.
♪ C-R-A-Z-Y ♪
Okay!
We get it!
Oh, is that Greg again? Look at that.
He has texted you six times already today.
Yeah, because he is my friend.
We're friends.
We're gonna go to a movie as friends.
It's like he's a stalker.
Okay?
No one likes a stalker.
Oh. The eagle and the bitch have landed.
Really?
Let me see.
Let me see. Let me see.
Um, Joshy, do you need, um, glasses?
Because the door is right over there.
Oh. My bad, babe.
Okay, well...
I hope they like the rice cooker I got them.
Everyone likes rice, right?
It's a very versatile grain.
What?
Are you crazy?
You don't want them snuggling up over the one dish that connects their cultures.
I'm gonna go give them this gift. Okay.
- I'll be right back, okay?
- Forget the gift.
Forget about the gift.
I am just trying to snap you back into reality, because now that Josh and Valencia are living together, you are not gonna have any more alone time with him.
Well, you know what?
I just want him to be happy. Ooh!
Oh, my gosh, Joshy, I'm so glad we finally moved in together.
It's the beginning of our happily ever after.
Yes, it's cool.
Plus, we'll be close to...
Marriage?
Kids?
I was going to say Taco Bell.
There's only one thing missing.
The salsa?
You just ask for it.
No, furniture, Joshy.
I mean, we don't even have a dining room table.
But we'll get one.
Let's burn sage.
Shoot, I forgot to get that.
Joshy, I needed that sage to cleanse the house of evil spirits.
Ghosts are obsessed with me.
I'll get it right now.
I love you.
Ugh, I hate her.
She's worse than all the Kardashians combined.
Except for Caitlyn, who is a national hero.
I'm just gonna call Josh and see if it's cool that I come over.
Do you need me to call Valencia from a burner phone and tell her there's been a murder at the yoga studio so you and Josh can have more alone time?
You came up with that way too quickly. Oh, he pressed "ignore""
Oh... oh... that doesn't feel good.
It's fine, it's fine.
He's busy.
I get it, I'm busy, too!
I won't even think about it.
I don't want to feel this way.
I reject this feeling.
I respectfully decline this feeling.
Hey, here she is!
Here's my MVP.
You ready to kick butt at that meeting?
Huh?
Calvin Young is the most important potential client we have ever had.
I'm joking. I mean, he is.
I mean, landing him would make us West Covina's premiere law firm.
But, by the time you knock his socks off today, wine and dine him over the weekend and then do your presentation on Monday, he will be...
Putty in our hands.
- Oh. - Are you okay?
I mean, you look a little peaked.
Never felt better.
I definitely won't press ignore... on this case.
Okay.
What?
"Mr. Young, I know that you have your choice of law firms "to represent you in this matter "of Josh moving into a new apartment with his hot girlfriend... " No!
_
Well, then, why do I have you in the office?
Huh? Gotcha there, bottle. Oh...
Do you know the signs and symptoms of the dreaded panic attack?
Well, if you don't, you need to join me for my week long marathon where I'm gonna teach you how to identify the symptoms, such as shortness of breath... heart palpitations, the urge to self-medicate with drugs and booze.
He's here!
Whole firm is counting on you.
Okay, I'm coming. Scott, I am asking you to drive carpool for one day.
I do it every day.
Oh... fine.
Fine, okay, whatever, I gotta go.
It's nice to... feel appreciated.
Mmm.
Your perfume is delightful.
Thank you.
I rubbed a magazine on myself this morning.
Well, it smells like a cherub dancing in the morning dew. Oh.
I'm Calvin Young.
Ah!
Paula Proctor.
Welcome to Whitefeather.
Are we, by chance, going to the same meeting?
Yes.
Follow me.
Calvin Young.
Nice to meet you.
Hi, Karen, the case assistant.
Please excuse my handshake.
I have naturally damp hands.
It's a medical condition.
I am in some studies.
Shall we be seated?
You okay?
Mm?
Mm.
- May I get you some coffee, Mr. Young?
- Yes.
Uh, French press, if you have it.
French press.
Mr. Young, we are so excited to have this opportunity to bring you into the Whitefeather family.
'Cause that's what we are.
A family that can help you acquire the industrial acreage you're looking for.
Well, I am pleased to be here, Darryl.
Well, we are determined to show you everything that we're capable of.
And to do that...
I can think of no one else but our closer.
Um, why don't you take it away, there, Rebecca?
- Rebecca?
- Hmm?
Would you please take it away? Welcome, Calvin.
Oh, my God, your teeth are blue.
Have you been drinking the water from the toilet?
Oh, crap.
It's ink.
Must've been from my pen cup.
Okay.
Welcome... to Joshfeather.
Oh...
White... feather.
Oh, God.
What happened to you in there?
That's not the Rebecca I know.
I mean, something is wrong.
Karen said that she smells vodka on you.
Well, that's ridiculous.
Vodka doesn't smell.
Listen, Darryl, I know I didn't bring my "A" game...
I think you need to go home.
Wait, are you taking me off the case?
Please don't take me off the case, because if you take me off the case, that means I'm not working and if I'm not working, that means I have to think thoughts.
Okay, you're not off the case.
But go home and work on the presentation.
And then, when you come back on Monday, I want you to be the happy Rebecca that we all know and love.
Such a good tip.
So helpful.
"Be happy." Hi, Paula.
Hey, are you okay?
I got back with Calvin's fancy coffee and Darryl said you weren't feeling well and you went home.
Yeah. Yeah, my blood sugar was a little low, so I decided to just come home and really focus on the presentation all weekend.
Hey, are you sure you're cool to do the Calvin dinner without me?
Well, I'll do my best.
Okay. Uh, I gotta hop off.
I'm really working hard here.
Bye! It's important to deal with one's feelings head-on, because repressed feelings lead to depression.
What do you know?
Repression equals depression.
That is... _
I'm tired, too.
_
I'm depressed, too.
Man... the French really know how to make depression look sexy.

♪ My lips are red from pain ♪

There is nothing sexy about depression, Rebecca.
Listen, you better get your act together, young lady, or you're gonna run this new life off in the ditch.
How did you get in here?
Well, your depressed mind invited me in.
And by the way, this place is a dump.
You ever think about maybe hanging a little art in here or something, anything?
Maybe a mural?
I don't know about this.
Are you sure this is the dining table she wants?
I don't know.
- I want to surprise her.
- Surprise her?
With furniture?
She's very picky, dude.
Yeah, yesterday you got in trouble because you bought the wrong kind of sage.
You bought the kind you put in food, not the kind you scare ghosts away with.
Valencia's intense, bro.
As sexy as she is, she's intense.
She has final approval over all your clothing.
Yeah, you know... yes.
I really miss your cargo's.
We all do.
Guys, I'm committed to this relationship.
I want to contribute.
You know?
She's done everything.
She picked out the apartment, she booked the moving trucks.
We're supposed to be a team and I want to do something for her.
So we gonna do this or what?
Yes. Yes, we are going to do this.
Guys, we can bang this out.
According to this, it is a very simple - 72-step process. - 72-step process.
Oh, hell no.
Okay.
We're not doing that.
We lost Hector.
What are you looking for?
Oh, my God, you're still here.
Tell it to me straight.
Am I schizophrenic?
I'm not really here.
I'm just in your imagination.
I mean, let's face it:
you do have a very active imagination.
One minute, you're walking down the street, the next minute, you're in a big musical.
Although, I gotta say, I did love the pretzel.
You did a good job on that one.
Yes!
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
Aw, it's a shoelace tip.
Ugh, that's gross.
Oh, my God, you're looking for prescription meds in a drawer?
So?
Listen, when I moved here, I thought I was okay, so I dumped them all my meds and now, you know, I realize that I'm not okay.
I mean, look at me, I'm falling apart here.
This is really bad.
So if I can just get my old prescription meds back, I'll be okay.
Uh, here's a thought.
Anxiety, depression... how about you see a doctor first?
I'll go do that.
Ten steps ahead of you.
Thank you so much for seeing me on such short notice, Dr. Akopian.
What can I help you with?
Yeah...
I'm not myself right now.
We're always ourselves, Rebecca.
Right. Yeah.
No, so I don't feel like myself.
This isn't usually how I am.
Like, I'm normally very organized and focused.
Sounds like you're feeling out of control.
Let's delve into your childhood.
Oh, I was afraid you'd say that.
Okay, so, I've been through the therapy wringer, I've rehashed my childhood a ton.
And I don't really want to do it again.
Like, for me and for you, frankly,
I don't want to put that on you.
So here's what I need.
I need these.
Those are the meds I was on in New York.
Oh, my God.
How did your body react to all this medication?
You must not have been able to feel a thing.
Exactly.
Numb as they come.
So... scribble scribble on your pizzle pad.
Rebecca, your doctor in New York is a quack.
He gave you a Band-Aid, not a cure.
My method would be to do some digging and figure out what's really going on inside your mind.
And then we can discuss the appropriate medications.
So that's great, but I need to be better by Monday.
It's a work thing, so...
We doing this?
No, we're not.
Okay.
Okay, well, you know what?
You'll be hearing from me on Yelp.
Um, where is your rest room? Say, what time is your husband joining us?
Oh, Scott?
He bailed at the last minute.
He has rehearsal for his singing group.
And that's more important than this?
I don't mind.
I'm fine.
He does what he wants to do, I don't care.
I do what I want to do, he doesn't care.
It's basically the storybook romance I dreamed of as a little girl.
Aw, you see?
You guys get each other.
That's so cool.
How are my eyebrows?
Don't care.
They can be wonky. Few people know this, but bald eagles aren't bald at all.
You see, the name actually derives from a word meaning "white headed."
And being a "white feather,"
well, I've always felt very connected to our national bird.
Actually, it's my spirit animal.
May I just say this is an adorable red? Unconventionally alluring, with the soul of a poet.
Thank you.
I got it at the gas station, but in the ten-dollar bin.
In the future, you really should try some of the Arizona wines.
Blend those with a smooth Camembert...
Mmm!
Heaven.
Oh, I am imagining that.
Mmm...
Camembert.
It's fun to say.
Oh, you know what?
Let's play a game. Oh! Yeah.
You tell me everything about you, - don't skip a thing, go. - Okay.
I was born in Irvine, California.
Um, my favorite color is green...
- Not you. - Oh.
Ladies first.
Of course.
I'm sorry.
You know what?
Calvin, you're the guest, so you should go first.
Go ahead.
Okay, well, um, I was born in Prescott, but I knew a small town wasn't for me, so I moved to the big city.
- Phoenix?
- Tucson.
Right.
Yeah, and I, uh, met my lovely wife.
Ten years of bliss... and then she died.
No! It was a, uh, short and tragic illness.
The last thing she said was...
"Calvin,
"be happy.
"Take life and... and grab it."
And you should.
You should take whatever you want.
Just take and grab.
Hmm.
I'm gonna roll.
Okay.
Okay, let's see... pink pill with the number 55 on it...
Yes!
ADD medication.
I've always wanted to take this.
- Wait a minute.
- What?
Do-do I really need to tell you don't take a pill you found on the bathroom floor next to the toilet?
Here me out, Dr. Phil.
It improves focus and promotes goal-directed behavior.
That's exactly the mojo that I need.
Rebecca, I know what it says, and I know what you need.
You need to focus on this:
Josh could find you if he wanted to.
You have made yourself really easy to find.
You have been rejected.
Rejected.
He doesn't want you.
That's reality.
Deal with it.
No.
I'm not gonna listen to you.
You talk silly.
Oh, my God.
Oh, what's that, little pill?
"Eat me, Rebecca"?
Well, I think I will.
Pills don't talk.
Don't take it. She took it.
Let's get to work.
All right, let's see this presentation...
What is Karen doing?
She put two spaces after a period.
What is this, 1997?
Well, those have to go. Okay!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's kicking in right now.
Okay.
And what are these, Oxford commas?
Well, those have to go, too.
I just gotta edit this whole thing before I even start.
Karen!
I would love to show you around tomorrow morning.
There's, um, the Chino Hills State Park, the Azusa Fish Canyon Falls.
May I be so bold as to inquire your availability and whereabouts tomorrow afternoon?
Uh, what?
Do you like jazz?
Hot jazz?
Is there any other kind?
There's a small place in South Pasadena.
My friends who blow horn say it's the best little jazz boîte in town.
Would you and your husband like to join me for some smooth licks?
- I would. - Mmm.
I would.
Uh, but he's, uh, busy. He's... with rehearsal for his singing group.
He's always busy.
And, you know, he's not much of a licker.
Uh-huh.
What time do you want to pick me up? Uh... Okay, so I've been up all night and I hung the fish, painted the walls, put up the mural, cleaned out the fridge, redid the grout in the bathroom and for the finishing touch...
You're gonna be so excited!
Ta-da!
Christmas lights!
So, may I ask who's crazy now?
I never said you were crazy.
That's a derogatory term and I don't think it really applies to you.
Where were you in my senior gender studies class?
We'll talk about that later.
For now, it's time to get down to business.
But you know, before I get down to business, I'm just gonna see what my friends are up to.
Instagram, oh!
Valencia posted a lovely picture of them in their new bedroom.
It says ♪Christened...
How nice.
Oh, nice to hear.
How's that working for you?
I don't understand your question.
But you know what, I'm starting to realize that maybe that pill was not what I needed.
Oh, there's a shocker.
Just spare me.
Spare me the wisecracks. Hey, it's me.
You got any downers?
Is this enough of a downer for you?
Oh, my God.
I could just melt into the chair, like, like a butter lady.
That's good.
No, that's bad.
Because I can't get work done right now.
Oh, I have an idea.
It's the most fantastic-iest idea.
That's not a real word.
Seriously, seriously, seriously.
Seriously, are you busy right now?
No. Oh...
Honey, hi.
Yeah, I-I'll be home in, like, an hour, tops.
Thanks, Booboo. Valencia's so mad at me.
We've been here all night, and I haven't even finished sorting the screws.
Josh, there's still time to bail.
On the table, I mean.
We were friends with you before we even met this table.
Uh, the truth is none of us really even
like the current table.
I hate this table.
We don't like, um, this table.
And you're going to ruin your life if you stick with this table.
Bros before... tables.
I think it's a nice thing you're doing.
Nicest thing I ever did for a girl was pull out.
Hector?
She has tandem parking, so after I'm there for a while, I have to pull out. Oh.
Which is such a pain, 'cause it feels so great just to leave it in there.
The worst is when it's alternate side of the street parking, 'cause then I got to park it in back.
I don't even get why there's a spot back there.
It's so tight.
Feels more like an exit.
So then I'm going front, back, front, back... and it's all dirty in the back, so when I move it to the front, then that gets all dirty.
I'm just happy I have a spot at all.
'Cause I used to have to pay.
Well, that was edifying. Oh!
This burrito is a symphony. Dr. Akopian's gonna be so happy to see me.
When I pop up, she's gonna be like,
"Whoa, you're so chill!
I'm gonna give you all the drugs""
Well, I want to check out her bathroom floor and see what else she has lying around. Hmm.
I bet her vacuum cleaner is filled with cool pharmaceuticals.
That's such a good point!
I know.
I wonder what she has in there.
Dr. Akopian?
Dr. Akopian, it's me Rebecca Bunch!
I'm really cool and chill now.
Dr. Akopian?
Okay, not giving up, not giving up!
Here, Dr. Akopian?
Dr. Akop...?
Oh, my God, it's her prescription pad.
Oh, I see it!
Wait, she wouldn't have left it by the window if she didn't, like, want somebody to take it, right?
Yeah, it's like a wizard test.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Whoa...
Wait, wait, what are you doing?
You can't fit through there.
Yeah, yeah, I totally can.
Because look at me...
Look how tiny I am.
I'm tiny...
I'm child-size. I'm a puppy.
I'm a poodle.
I'm a shrimp.
Yeah, I'm going.
Okay, yeah, all right.
Okay.
Oh, no, I think I'm stuck.
Oh, we forgot.
You're small, but you got those British-nanny-sized boobs.
British nanny... Hello, guv'nor.
Please, sir, may I have some pills? Ah, your best table, please, sir.
Oh, I don't work here.
Oh, well, this will spot you till you get back on your feet then, huh?
Oh, no, I-I have a job.
Please.
Seat the lady, hmm? Ah, I love jazz.
I mean, the Charlie Brown theme song, come on.
Ah, The Vince Guaraldi Trio.
Though some mistakenly think it's Brubek.
Welcome to Smoky Jazzzz.
My name is Ike.
Our specialty cocktail tonight is called The Chimney.
Mmm, well those sound good.
Uh, two of those, uh, top shelf, and, uh, make those, uh, chilled glasses.
Wow, you have all those fancy cards I see commercials for.
Well, I like perks.
I live for perks.
Yeah.

♪ Squeedle, squeedle da doos ♪ ♪ Squeedle... ♪ Uh, hmm. ♪ Squeedle little lips ♪

Well, this is a wonderful place.
I've lived here forever.
I didn't even know it was here.
Well, I've learned in all my travels all the cities, no matter what size has a hidden gem.
Well, where have you been, traveling-wise?
Oh, everywhere.
You name it, I've been there at least once.
- Paris.
- Well, not Paris.
- Rome?
- I'm more of a domestic traveler.
Right.
I've always wanted to travel. Hmm?
Scott does.
My husband.
His barbershop quartet goes to places like Fresno and Bakersfield.
I would kill for a trip to Fresno.
Well, you deserve to go to all the places your heart desires.
Oh, you're very nice.
You are a class act. Ooh. Ooh.

Are you? You know I could - have you both arrested?
I'm a student.
On what grounds?
Breaking and entering.
First of all, I only half-entered.
And second of all, as far as the breaking goes, you have no idea of my intent to steal your prescription pad.
I do now. Ah!
But since you were both stoned when you broke in, and not in your right mind...
I'm willing to offer you a deal, Ms. Bunch.
Make an appointment and start to get help and I won't press charges against either of you.
Fine.
Yeah.
You win.
Let's do this.
I will come in here, I will explore my feelings, do whatever you want.
Now can I have the drugs?
We're done here.
I'm done.
I give up.
I'm gonna take a nap here for just a... year. What about your job thingy?
Oh, God, I hope Darryl doesn't fire me.
Do me a favor?
Can you get my phone?
I think it's in your purse.
I know, I'm just too tired.
Can you get it?
Just put it in my hand?
Just place it inside my hand.
It's coming.
Place it inside. - There.
- Thank you.
Mmm...
Hi, Paula.
It's me.
Yeah, okay, listen, I got something to tell you.
I'm not proud of it.
I cannot do the presentation with Calvin on Monday.
Can you tell Darryl for me?
I'm-I'm actually with Calvin, so I could just tell him.
What?
Okay.
We are at the hotel on East Cameron and he just went out for ice, and I only have a second.
Hotel?
Why are you at a ho...
Is that Anita Baker playing in the background?
Oh, oh, he's coming back.
I gotta go.
Paula!
Paula?
I need a cab.
Uber.
I need an Uber.
Oh, okay. Actually, no, forget the Uber, it's just around the corner.
Come on!
I've never been in a hotel room with a couch before.
Uh, all the perks. I can't believe I'm doing this.
It's like a fantasy... like strawberries and champagne is just gonna magically arrive at the door.
Don't do it!
Look at that.
It's beautiful!
She's gonna love it.
I-I feel so great about this. She's here.
She's here, guys.
Yeah!
Okay, shh, shh, shh, shh. Mwah.
Okay. Okay. Left, left, left, left, left.
What? Left.
What is it?
Surprise!
It's your new dining room table.
We stayed up all night making it for you.
- That you didn't pick out.
- And I helped.
That's so sweet.
So, do you like it?
Well... it doesn't match our other things.
It's not exactly what I would've picked out.
Oh, well, I mean, if it's... not something you want, I mean, I guess I...
You could take it apart and give it back?
Josh, you are so smart.
That's a great idea.
Give me a kiss.
Mwah.
Okay, I got to go back to class, you guys, but thank you so much.
Oh, and you all should come over for dinner when we have the right table.
Yeah?
Okay. Bye.
She scares me so bad.
Look, Paula,
I know your marriage is crap. I get it.
And I get that you're about to have the hottest sex of your life.
Mmm. Right. So why are you stopping me?
Because it's not real.
It's a Band-Aid.
You know that.
Remember the other day when you were trying to get me to face my reality, right?
And I didn't get it?
Now I get it.
You're doing the exact same thing.
You need to face your real problem, and your real problem is that your marriage is dead.
And you need to fully feel that, and you need to face it, because this is just a temporary fix.
It's like a pill you found on the bathroom floor.
Who would take a pill they found on the floor?
Look, look, I've spent my whole life numbing myself, okay?
I have spent my whole life escaping to far-off places, and it's only recently, like, now, like, literally this second that I realize, like, I can't do that!
I can't do that.
I have to feel my feelings.
It's okay to feel, Paula.
It's been five years since I made love without the TV on. And ten years since somebody held my hand. I-I miss my dead wife.
Come here.
Literally the most entertaining day of my life.
Rebecca, making a speech like that in front of a potential client, that... was brave.
Also a bit foolish.
In most cases, clients would run in the opposite direction.
And I understand if this means you don't want to work with me...
Look, let me finish.
You have the kind of no-nonsense honesty and raw emotional insight that I look for in a commercial real estate lawyer. You are a wonderful woman,
Paula.
This weekend has been so special.
But marriage is a precious thing.
If I could hold my wife for one more second... Oh.
Don't make me cry again. Is this alpaca?
It's so soft.
My dead white wife loved alpaca. What did you say to Calvin?
He was so impressed, he's not even seeing other people.
I mean, how did you swing that?
I just was honest about... about all the great work you do,
Darryl.
I just made him see what you wanted him to see, that we're a group of kick-ass lawyers and we're a family.
Yeah.
Oh, Darryl.
It's okay.
Let it out.
Feel your feelings.
Everyone should feel their feelings.
Everyone should always feel their feelings.
Well, I, for one, am feeling peeved, because this copier...
Cork it, Karen!
But this copier...
Cork it!
Rebecca, I'm very glad you're welcoming the opportunity to work on yourself.
I am so grateful to be here, and I'm excited to face my problems head-on.
I know it's gonna be hard work, but it's work that I am prepared... it's work...
I'm sorry. I know I should just... work,
I should make sure this isn't an emergency.
One second.
_
You know what, I'm feeling better already, actually.
So I'm-I'm gonna go to this very important thing, but I want to let you know that this is not over. I'll see you next week.
What?
Get out of here!
A rice cooker?
That's perfect!
Because Valencia is Mexican and I'm Filipino and rice is a staple in both of our...
Cultures.
Yeah. Right.
Uh, oh, sorry it took me forever to return your call from Friday.
